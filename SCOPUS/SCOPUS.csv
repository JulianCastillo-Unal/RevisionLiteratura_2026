However, in vulnerable school contexts, access to meaningful STEM experiences remains limited. This study addresses this issue through the design and implementation of a didactic strategy in a public high school in Bogotá, Colombia, based on two educational resources: the BioSen electronic board, which is compatible with Arduino technology and designed to acquire physiological signals such as electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), and body temperature; and the Space Exploration instructional guide, which is organized around contextualized learning missions. This study employed a quasi-experimental mixed-methods design that combined pre–post perception questionnaires, unstructured classroom observations, and a contextualized knowledge test administered to three student groups. Findings demonstrate that after eight weeks of implementation with upper secondary students, the strategy had a positive impact on the development of 21st-century skills, such as creativity, computational thinking, and critical thinking. These skills were assessed through a mixed quasi-experimental design combining perception questionnaires, qualitative observations, and knowledge evaluations. Unlike the control groups, students who participated in the intervention adjusted their self-perceptions when facing real-world challenges and showed progress in the application of key competencies. Overall, the results support the effectiveness of integrating low-cost biomedical tools with gamified STEM instruction to enhance higher-order thinking skills and student engagement in vulnerable educational contexts. © 2025 by the authors.","21st-century skills; Arduino; biomedical engineering; educational strategy; electronic board; gamification; high school; STEM; teaching strategy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105025696776"

Various pedagogical approaches such as blended learning, gamification, computational thinking, experiential learning, and discussion-based learning have been explored in this context. This paper examines the effectiveness of a game-based learning approach. By immersing learners in real-world scenarios on a fictional island, the educational game teaches SQL through problem-solving rather than isolated query writing, thereby preparing students for authentic database management tasks.Compared to problem-based learning, the game-based pedagogy demonstrated superior results in both learning outcomes and engagement. The study involved 150 undergraduate students enrolled in a Database Management Systems course. As part of the assignment, students engaged with SQL Island, an educational game designed to teach SQL concepts. To evaluate its effectiveness, a questionnaire based on the MEEGA + model (Model for the Evaluation of Educational Games) was administered, assessing usability, operability, aesthetics, and relevance to the course.Findings revealed positive outcomes in terms of player experience and learning. Student engagement in this activity surpassed that of other initiatives such as mini-projects or problem-based learning. Performance also improved significantly, with a 15% increase overall. In the pre-test, only 70% of students could successfully write all queries, whereas in the post-test, 85% achieved complete success. These results highlight the remarkable improvement in both engagement and performance when learning database concepts through game-based methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.","Educational games; Game-based learning; Pedagogy; Player experience; SQL concept","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105023425844"

CT, which includes problem-solving, abstraction, and algorithmic reasoning, is a vital competency for success in the digital age. TMAR technology uniquely combines physical and digital interactions, providing immersive, hands-on experiences that engage students in real-world problem-solving and make CT skill development more intuitive and compelling. By incorporating SGC, a learner-centered approach where students create their own content – in our case, design challenges – for themselves or peers, the proposed method promotes creativity, critical thinking, and learner agency in game-based learning. The effectiveness of this approach was compared to a gameplay-only method in a single-session experiment involving 33 elementary students, aged 8 to 10 years, randomly assigned to experimental (SGC with gameplay) and control (gameplay-only) groups. Although no statistically significant differences were found, the experimental group outperformed the control group with a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.48, partial η² = 0.058), suggesting a potentially meaningful impact of SGC on CT development. Findings from this exploration revealed positive attitudes toward learning and increased engagement with the SGC strategy. The study also identified challenges and provided valuable insights for more effective integration of student-generated challenges within TMAR games. The paper concludes with design considerations aimed at enhancing CT development, enriching learning experiences, and guiding future research in this area. © The Author(s) 2025.","Computational thinking; Educational technology; Elementary education; Game-Based learning; Student-Generated challenges; Tangible mobile augmented reality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105023391148"

Programming education supported by structured pedagogical approaches can lay the groundwork for success in software engineering pathways. In this study, the effect of the use of the problem-based learning (PBL) approach in programming education on students' CT skills, performance, and attitudes toward collaboration was investigated. In addition, detailed comparisons were made according to instructor-selected (IS) and self-selected (SS) collaborative groups. The embedded mixed methods research design was used in the study. The sample of the study consisted of a total of 52 seventh-grade secondary school students (25 boys and 27 girls) taking Scratch programming lessons. The results revealed that the use of the PBL approach in programming education improves children's CT skills. The children's attitudes toward collaboration in programming were high. Although group cohesion was higher in the SS group, it increased on a weekly basis in the IS group. Moreover, it has been determined that the projects produced in the IS group were more qualified. The study underlines the importance of investing in software engineering education to equip the next generation of software engineers with the necessary skills to thrive in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Implications are discussed in terms of theoretical insights, practices, and directions for further research. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","Collaborative learning; Computational thinking; Engineering education; Programming education; Secondary education","Computer software; Curricula; Professional aspects; Software design; Software quality; Students; Teaching; Collaborative learning; Computational thinkings; Group cohesions; Group performance; Problem-based learning approaches; Programming education; School students; Secondary education; Secondary schools; Thinking skills; Engineering education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007911956"

This research addresses a gap in current understanding of how role structures affect problem-solving and collaborative behaviors in TMAR-based learning environments. A quasi-experimental research approach within-subjects design was used. The study involved 23 elementary school students who participated in an educational game designed to develop computational thinking skills. These students worked in small groups, using mobile devices and physical artifacts as markers to solve problems. Two modes of collaboration were examined: (1) emergent-role collaboration, where participants self-organized, and (2) scripted-role collaboration, where scripted roles were assigned. Qualitative content analysis was conducted to interpret qualitative data from structured observations and student feedback. Findings suggest that the effectiveness of TMAR-based collaboration depends on the group's underlying goal orientation. In goal-aligned groups, roles emerged naturally and supported productive interaction, while in less cohesive groups, scripted roles provided the necessary structure. Furthermore, the tangible features of TMAR show evidence of further support for role distribution and collaborative problem-solving when used appropriately. These insights contribute to the broader field of collaborative learning, computational thinking, and the application of TMAR in formal education settings. © 2025 The Authors","Classroom integration; Collaborative learning; Group dynamics; K-12; STEM; Tangible mobile augmented reality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007803081"

Although these factors have been studied separately, their combined effects remain underexplored. To address this gap, a 2×2 factorial experiment was conducted in this study to examine the effect of scaffolding type (conceptual versus problem-solving) and timing (immediate versus delayed) on CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. A total of 136 third graders from four classes were assigned to four experimental conditions: delayed conceptual scaffolding, immediate conceptual scaffolding, immediate problem-solving scaffolding, and delayed problem-solving scaffolding. The study was conducted over 6 weeks using the machine learning unit of an artificial intelligence (AI) course. The results, as measured by knowledge tests and final worksheets, showed that problem-solving scaffolding and immediate scaffolding were more effective in developing students’ CT concepts than conceptual scaffolding and delayed scaffolding. Lag sequential analysis indicated that students guided by problem-solving scaffolding and delayed scaffolding developed more complete problem-solving paths and achieved higher levels of CT practice. Additionally, an analysis of students’ learning reflections revealed that most students could explain the functions of machine learning techniques. However, students guided by problem-solving scaffolding and immediate scaffolding were better at understanding and reflecting on the problem-solving process. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practical guidance for teachers. By highlighting effective scaffolding methods and their timing, this study advances CT education and helps prepare students for a technology-driven world. © This article of Educational Technology & Society is available under Creative Commons CC-BY NC-ND 3.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).","Artificial intelligence; Computational thinking; Elementary education; Scaffolding; Timing of scaffolding","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105019696979"

However, reaching an academic consensus regarding which approach is more effective remains elusive. This study presents a meta-analysis of 37 studies published between January 2006 and March 2025. These studies are used to compare the effectiveness of UA and PA for developing students' CT. The results indicate that, overall, PA (g = 0.606) is more effective than UA (g = 0.501) in developing students' CT. This study also compares the effects of UA and PA across the four moderator variables of educational level, intervention duration, type of course, and learning model. The results show that UA is better than PA in terms of developing students’ CT in game-based learning. However, PA is better than UA in secondary school and college, in interventions lasting less than four weeks, humanities and arts courses, and problem-based and project-based learning. The effect of UA and PA on students' CT development may be quite similar in the primary education stage, when the intervention duration exceeds four weeks, in information and technology courses, and in natural science courses. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2025.","Computational thinking; Meta-analysis; Plugged-in activities; Unplugged activities","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007432195"

This experimental study integrates four principal gamification elements—role-playing, rewards, challenges, and cooperation—into unplugged children’s coding education tools to examine their impacts on children’s flow experience and learning engagement. Under the theoretical framework of Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R), researchers developed an unplugged coding education prototype named “Coding Adventure,” employing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach with 295 Chinese elementary students (aged 8–10 years). Subsequent qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 stratified participants. Empirical findings demonstrate that role-playing and cooperation effectively enhance children’s flow experience when engaging in coding education tools. Children role-play heroes and engage in “real fights,” engage in teamwork and communicate with others, which can bring them into a flow experience. The flow experience effectively enhances children’s learning engagement. The main reasons are the immersion, upgrade experience, practicality, goal-orientedness, teamwork and partner’s suggestions brought by gamification elements. Moreover, rewards and cooperation also directly positively influence children’s learning engagement. Intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, engagement in teamwork and receiving encouragement and suggestions from interactions with classmates are thought to increase children’s motivation to learn. This study examined the effects of diverse gamification elements on children’s flow experience and learning engagement in an unplugged gamified coding education tool under the framework of the S-O-R theory. Additionally, this study demonstrated important practical implications by providing developers of coding education tools with a clear path to enhancing participants’ sense of immersion and achievement. © 2025 Huang, Wang.

To achieve an integrated computational literacy CT research must study new approaches that from the one side utilize multiple computational tools beyond traditional programming, such as databases and modelling tools, and from the other side employ CT for dealing with both the scientific and the societal aspects of real-world problems. To this end, this article explores the development of 16 middle school students’ computational thinking practices as they collaboratively play and modify the socio-scientific simulation game “CT-Chef” with three interconnected affordances, i.e., map design, data editing and block-based programming, in “ChoiCo” environment. The in-depth thematic analysis of students’ interactions throughout the activities, revealed new, system and data related, dimensions of known CT practices that have not yet been explored or detected in traditional programming-centred approaches. Moreover, the results showed that the progressive transition of student roles from players to designers enabled the development of abstract reasoning about the simulation game system. Finally, as designers of the socio-scientific game content, students questioned, discussed and modified the subjective societal values and possible biases behind the simulation. Based on the findings, the article discusses a framework of three axes, i.e., computational tools, engagement process and content, for utilizing CT in socio-scientific contexts. © The Author(s) 2025.","Computational thinking; Constructionism; Game-based learning; Multiple representations; Socio-scientific issues; Systems thinking","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000290895"

Research suggests that different game elements in DGBL may elicit varying levels of motivation and affect outcomes. In a digital game designed for CT learning, this study examined the complex relationship among rewards, competition, motivation, and learning outcomes. Data were collected from 216 secondary school students across ten different classes, who were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: power-up rewards with competition, power-up rewards only, customization rewards with competition, customization rewards only, and a control condition with no rewards or competition. Regression analysis revealed that power-up rewards impacted CT learning indirectly by reducing tension, although they did not directly influence motivation or CT outcomes. Customization rewards showed no significant effects on motivation or CT outcomes. Although competition alone did not significantly influence motivation or CT outcomes, its combination with power-up rewards weakened CT outcomes compared with power-up rewards alone without competition. The study suggests that competition may dilute the positive effects of rewards, emphasizing the need for careful integration of reward structures in DGBL. The study provides valuable insights for designing DGBL interventions that balance rewards and competition while minimizing tension to achieve optimal learning outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Competition; Computational thinking; DGBL; Digital games; Mediation and moderation; Motivation; Regression analysis; Rewards; Tension","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219045819"

Scholarly investigations have delved into appropriate approaches for enhancing these proficiencies within early childhood classrooms. The present study aims to investigate the impact of a digital story design program, or Design-Based Digital Story Program (DBDS), on the coding and CT skills of 5-year-old children. Specifically designed for children aged 3–6, the DBDS program aligns with constructivism principles, which promote experiential learning. Employing a case–control quasi-experimental design, the study employed pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments and a follow-up retest after one month. The intervention involved implementing the digital story design program over 11 weeks, with three sessions per week, each lasting between 60 to 90 min, targeting five-year-old participants. The findings reveal that the DBDS program significantly enhances CT and coding skills compared to a control group. Moreover, female participants exhibited more significant improvements in CT skills post-intervention than their male counterparts, while no significant gender-based effects were observed in coding skills. These findings suggest that the DBDS program effectively supports the cultivation of coding and CT abilities among young children, warranting further exploration in diverse educational settings and across various grade levels. © The Author(s) 2024.","Computational thinking; Design-based learning; Early years education; Improving classroom teaching; Twenty-first century abilities","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201831296"

While most researchers are concentrating on defining CT and developing tools for its instruction and assessment, we focus on the characteristics of computational thinking problems (CTPs)- activities requiring CT to be solved-and how they influence the skills students can develop. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for systematically profiling CTPs by identifying specific components and characteristics, while establishing a link between these attributes and a structured catalogue of CT competencies. The purposes of this framework are (i) facilitating the analysis of existing CTPs to identify which abilities can be developed or measured based on their inherent characteristics, and (ii) guiding the design of new CTPs targeted at specific skills by outlining the necessary characteristics required for CT activation. To illustrate the framework functionalities, we begin by analysing prototypical activities in the literature, a process that leads to the definition of a taxonomy of CTPs across various domains, and we conclude with a case study on the design of a different version of one of these activities, the Cross Array Task (CAT), set in different cognitive environments. This approach allows an understanding of how CTPs in different contexts display unique and recurring characteristics that promote the development of distinct skills. In conclusion, this framework can inform the development of assessment tools, improve teacher training, and facilitate the analysis and comparison of existing CT activities, contributing to a deeper understanding of competency activation and guiding curriculum design in CT education. © The Author(s) 2025.","Analytical framework; Cognitive environment; Computational thinking; Digital education; Learning activity design; Skill development","Analytical framework; Case-studies; Cognitive environment; Computational thinkings; Digital education; Inherent characteristics; Learning Activity; Learning activity design; Skills development; Specific component","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000721200"

However, it is a challenging task to accurately measure the CT levels of the students. The goal of this study is to explore a new CT assessment paradigm that combines a data-driven approach with evidence-based reasoning, and to verify the reliability and validity of this paradigm through an empirical study. Specifically, we examined middle school students’ CT by adopting an Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) approach. We first developed a CT evaluation framework based on ECD which included student, task, and evidence models. We then created several simulation-based tasks to gather evidence of CT levels; with these tasks, we extracted the observable variables in ECD model from clickstream data during the students’ answer process. Finally, a Bayesian network model was used for CT level prediction. Findings suggest that students’ clickstream data provide fine-grained, time-variant information on their interactions with tasks, thus promising more objective and richer insight into the performances of students with different CT levels. This study provides a paradigm reference for future CT measurement studies and proposes ideas for using process data in teaching to promote students’ CT development. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2025.","Clickstream data; Computational thinking; Data mining application; Evidence-centered design; Middle school students","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000275656"

Particularly, students with intellectual disabilities need equal educational opportunities and high-quality informatics education to cultivate CT-based problem-solving skills. However, research on the enhancement of CT-based problem-solving skills, specifically among students with intellectual disabilities, is scant. Therefore, this study analyzed the improvement of CT-based problem-solving skills through programming education tailored to students with mild intellectual disabilities in an inclusive educational environment, using evaluation tools that reflect the multidimensional aspects of CT. The study involved 4 students with intellectual disabilities and 9 students without intellectual disabilities. A customized programming education course, comprising 6 sessions, was designed based on a Universal Design for Learning. Additionally, a pre-posttest consisting of 14 items was developed to evaluate multidimensional CT-based problem-solving skills. The results of the study indicated that the improvement in CT-based problem-solving skills during the stages of problem understanding and algorithm representation was limited. However, significant improvements were observed during the programming and debugging stages among most participants. The findings underscore the necessity of customized programming education for students with intellectual disabilities, and highlight the need for individualized education to address specific challenges faced in programming education.

However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice. © 2025 The Authors","Computational thinking, Scratch, constructionism; Computer science, Teachers; Teachers’ perceptions","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216106697"

To investigate the effectiveness of augmented reality-based gamified teaching and learning and the differences in effectiveness under different competitive strategies, this study developed a gamified learning course and the accompanying AR software, and conducted a systematic random sampling of 175 first-year university students to differentiate between different experimental groups, with those who used a team competitive strategy as the control group and those who used an individual competitive strategy as the experimental group, and used the Cultural Literacy, Computational Thinking, Cognitive Load and Game Experience questionnaire instruments to measure learning outcomes. Results showed that the use of augmented reality-based gamification learning strategies significantly improved students' cultural literacy and algorithmic thinking in computational thinking. The collaboration group had a significantly higher sense of positive game experience and cultural literacy than the individual group, while the individual group had significantly higher mental effort and cognitive load than the collaboration group.

Findings suggest that design tasks encouraged shifts from surface-level CT definitions to more applied reasoning, particularly in decomposition and algorithmic thinking during storyboard development. However, participants encountered new challenges during 3D implementation, including spatial logic demands and limited debugging fluency.

The results indicate that students primarily struggle with understanding loops (both simple and nested), while difficulties with selection structures and sequence structures are less pronounced. Regarding game elements, students face difficulties in interpreting command symbols representing directions, understanding graphical interface elements representing programming constructs, and managing complex user interfaces. The results imply a need for further empirical studies to explore how well students can apply their acquired programming knowledge to contexts beyond games.

Consequently, computer science education for children at early ages has become increasingly important. This study conducts a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of the interventions using educational robotics as well as computer-aided mathematics drills (via a “math app”) on students' performance in primary schools in Basra, Iraq. We provide several new empirical findings. First, the short-run impact of robotics-based learning on computational thinking is positive and statistically significant for girls, particularly poor performing girls, but not for boys. Second, the impact on computational thinking is augmented by introducing a math app, further improving computational thinking. Together, these two interventions also enhance general intelligence. Third, the positive impact was still evident more than three months after the interventions for girls who received both computer science and math education, suggesting their complementarity.

However, developing effective serious games is complex, and a more systematic approach is needed to create better evidence-based games. Learning analytics—based on the analysis of collected in-game user interactions—can support game development and the players’ learning process, providing assessment information to teachers, students, and other stakeholders. However, empirical studies applying and demonstrating the use of learning analytics in the context of serious games in real environments remain scarce. In this paper, we study the application of learning analytics throughout the whole lifecycle of a serious game, in order to assess the game’s design and players’ learning using a serious game that introduces basic programming concepts through a visual programming language. The game was played by N = 134 high school students in two 50-min sessions. During the game sessions, all player interactions were collected, including the time spent solving levels, their programming solutions, and the number of replays. We analyzed these interaction traces to gain insights that can facilitate teachers’ use of serious games in their lessons and assessments, as well as guide developers in making possible improvements to the game. Among these insights, knowing which tasks students struggle with is critical for both teachers and game developers, and can also reveal game design issues. Among the results obtained through analysis of the interaction data, we found differences between boys and girls when playing. Girls play in a more reflexive way and, in terms of acceptance of the game, a higher percentage of girls had neutral opinions. We also found the most repeated errors, the level each player reached, and how long it took them to reach those levels. These data will help to make further improvements to the game’s design, resulting in a more effective educational tool in the future. The process and results of this study can guide other researchers when applying learning analytics to evaluate and improve the educational design of serious games, as well as supporting teachers—both during and after the game activity—in applying an evidence-based assessment of the players based on the collected learning analytics. © 2025 by the authors.","computational thinking; learning analytics; programming learning; serious games; visual programming","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Game design; Students; Visual analytics; Visual languages; Case-studies; Computational thinkings; Evidence-based; Interactive Environments; Learning analytic; Programming learning; Serious game development; Teachers'; User interaction; Visual programming; Serious games","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003494998"

We conceptualize learning by using elements of theories of community of practice, constructionism, and instrumental genesis. Data was collected through post-course voluntary anonymous questionnaires (N = 31) from the 2nd and 3rd courses. Our results suggest five key dimensions of learning outcomes falling under the three domains (cognitive, intrapersonal and interpersonal) of deeper learning: (1) programming as a useful tool for mathematics and more broadly; (2) computational thinking as a useful competency for mathematics and more broadly; (3) attitudes toward learning to program and programming practices (for mathematics); (4) interest and motivation in expanding one’s understanding of mathematical concepts; and (5) learning about self as a learner. Arising from these results, we argue that opportunities derived from conducting multiple programming-based pure and applied mathematics investigations may empower undergraduate students in their mathematical thinking and activity. © Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) 2025.","Computational thinking; Instrumental approach; Learning outcomes; Programming; Project-based learning; University mathematics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007533405"

The application of co-design pedagogical techniques has the potential to improve students’ CT learning through knowledge sharing and the creation of ideas to solve problems and develop an artifact. However, there is a limited understanding of how co-design pedagogical techniques have been explored to foster CT learning, which could hamper the successful use of co-design as a pragmatic teaching approach. This study examined the ways in which co-design pedagogical techniques have been applied in CT education by implementing a systematic literature review (PRISMA protocol) to document the review analysis. A total of 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria for this study were reviewed. Findings in this study revealed that workshops are the most utilized co-design learning setting and, as expected, the collaborative technique is the co-design pedagogical technique most frequently adopted for implementing CT in K-12 education. NetLogo is the most frequently used co-design tool for teaching and learning CT in K-12 education, and an interdependence exists between NetLogo and the Common Online Data Analysis Platform. Co-design also helps teachers develop the ability to use co-design pedagogical techniques to learn, create content, and integrate CT into their various subjects. This study contributes to practical knowledge by unraveling and advocating the use of dialogical, prompting, framing, and game-based techniques as co-design pedagogical techniques for K-12 teachers and also helps teachers identify useful co-design tools for learning CT. © The Author(s) 2024.","Co-design pedagogy; Computational thinking; K-12 education; Literature","Co-design pedagogy; Co-designs; Computational thinkings; Design pedagogy; Design tool; K-12 education; Literature; NetLogo; Pedagogical technique; Systematic literature review; Design","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001084147"

However, less is known about how the development of each construct relates to that of the other. With a sample of 997 grade 6 students (average age = 11.43 at the beginning of the school year) from 14 primary schools, we examined the co-development of students’ CT concepts and practices based on the research method commonly used in the literature on conceptual and procedural knowledge for studying the relations between the two constructs. We first designed an instrument to measure CT concepts using an evidence-based approach, and validated it through item response theory. By applying multidimensional item response theory, we confirmed the four dimensions of CT practices using an instrument applied in a previous study. We found that after one year of CT learning, the students had improved in terms of both concepts and practices, indicating the effectiveness of the CT intervention. Structural equation modelling indicated that CT concepts and practices facilitated each other’s development; practices played a particularly important role in facilitating the development of CT. Our study provides solid evidence for the importance of the problem-solving aspect of CT as reflected in the dimension of practices. It also provides valuable insights for future pedagogical models, such as allocating sufficient time for students to practise in programming tasks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Computational thinking; Conceptual knowledge; Practices; Primary students; Procedural knowledge","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200888506"

Findings: The findings revealed that students’ CT self-efficacy and their performance on understanding CT showed an opposite pattern and failed to meet instructors’ expectations. Moreover, students’ CT self-efficacy did not significantly predict their CT performance on application or understanding.

While there is a growing body of work exploring ways to decolonise programming education, far more needs to be done. Current research focuses on the language of instruction and contextual curricula; outward-facing engagements with decolonisation. However, to move towards digital-decoloniality involves scrutinising how programming knowledge is recontextualised within curricula. Part of the project should be equipping both educators and students with the tools to recontextualise programming itself. To dismantle the colonial logic embedded in programming education, attention must be given to the knowledge formation of the discipline to identify moments of disruption. One such moment is the difficulty students face when recontextualising their mental models of computing, from programming skills to programming concepts. This occurs at the moment of reading, tracing and writing code. Programming requires one to refocus computational thinking and engage with a specific semiotic system, translating the authors' intention into an executable computational process. Disrupting this moment using the strategies of critical literacies opens computer programming and its resulting code to critical examination, allowing an inward-facing decolonial engagement with the discipline. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, teachers find it challenging to implement the existing learning approaches in K-12 settings because the existing approaches often focus on teaching computing concepts and skills (i.e., programming skills) rather than on helping students develop their computational thinking competency—a competency that can be used across disciplinary boundaries in accordance with curriculum requirements. To address this need, the current study investigated how game-based learning influenced middle school students’ learning processes, particularly on the development of computational thinking competency, self-efficacy toward computational thinking, and engagement during gameplay. Additionally, the study examined how these outcomes were moderated by individual differences. We observed evidence that the gaming experience influenced students’ computational thinking self-efficacy, but not computational thinking competency or game-based engagement. Compared to age (grade) and prior gaming experience, gender tended to play a more important role in moderating students’ computational thinking competency, self-efficacy toward computational thinking competency, and game-based engagement.

Computational thinking is an analytical process that requires defining problems and at the same time solving these problems by proceeding in creative ways. Based on this possible pattern of relationship between computational thinking and creativity, the aim of this study was to determine how two different versions of the computational thinking approach (plugged and unplugged) affect 6th-grade students' creative problem-solving skills (CPSS). Thus, two different teaching modules were designed on the circulatory system with a focus on plugged and unplugged computational thinking. A quasi-experimental design was used. Experiment group 1 utilized the plugged teaching module, experiment group 2 worked with the unplugged teaching module, and the control group in the Turkish middle school science curriculum's inquiry-based science activities. All three groups participated in 16 h of lessons over a 4-week period. We utilized the Creative Problem Solving Skills Inventory (CPSSI) for data collection. The results demonstrated that both the plugged and unplugged teaching modules were more successful at enhancing the CPSS than the inquiry-based science activities. Furthermore the unplugged teaching module was significantly more successful in developing CPSS compared to inquiry-based science activities. Hence, this empirical study demonstrated that both plugged and unplugged computational thinking approaches can enhance CPSS, but also reveals the greater effectiveness of unplugged approaches in fostering middle school students' CPSS. © The Author(s) 2024.","Computational thinking; Creativity; Plugged approach; Problem solving; Unplugged approach","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195378321"

Quantitative data were collected using three different scales. These scales included the “Computational Thinking Scale”, “Online Cooperative Learning Attitude Scale (OCLAS)”, and “Creative Self-Efficacy Scale”. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), confirmatory factor analysis, and path analysis were conducted to analyze the quantitative data. The qualitative phase of the study consisted of nine science teachers. Data were collected with a semi-structured interview form by considering the scores obtained from the scales. Qualitative data were analyzed through descriptive analysis.

Understanding the relationship between students’ CT and relevant factors contributes to implementing and improving CT education. Most previous studies investigated the effect of demographic or attitudinal factors on CT performance; whereas few research explored the impact of mindset on CT, and how mindset potentially mediates the relationship between the affective and performance facets of CT. This study adapted a CT assessment instrument and validated it using item response theory (IRT) analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) among N = 961 middle school students in eastern China. Further, two SEMs were fitted and compared to investigate the impact of programming self-efficacy (PSE) and growth mindset (GM) on CT performance. Results revealed that both programming self-efficacy and growth mindset positively predicted CT. Moreover, growth mindset positively mediated the relationship between PSE and CT. Findings suggest that mindset interventions beyond programming are also facilitative for improving CT. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Computational thinking; Growth mindset; Programming self-efficacy; Secondary education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191775559"

This study seeks to fill this gap by employing gamified CT items across multiple difficulty levels to calculate comprehensive behavioral sequence quality indicators. And then, through latent profile analysis, we identified four distinct latent classes of behavioral process. We then examined the in-game performance differences among these classes, uncovering each class’s unique attributes. Class 1 students consistently demonstrated high-quality, efficient behavioral sequences regardless of item difficulty. In contrast, class 2 students applied significant cognitive effort and trial-and-error strategies, achieving acceptable scores despite low behavioral sequence quality. Class 3 students excelled in simpler items but faltered with more complex ones. Class 4 students displayed low motivation for challenging items, often guessing answers quickly. Additionally, we investigated the predictive value of students’ performance in gamified items and their behavioral process classes for their external CT test scores.

Thus, we introduce in this article the GameBot ZoAm, developed for the Discord instant messaging and social platform. ZoAm offers a unique learning experience centered around storytelling, focusing on fundamental computing concepts and logical challenges that enhance computational thinking skills. Furthermore, the game also promotes an appreciation for Amazonian culture and folklore, with decision-making with human values. An action research study was conducted involving students from the last years of the end of elementary school. The research utilized a heuristic analysis based on the Gameplay Heuristics (PLAY) by Desurvire and Wiberg (ANO) and the evaluation model proposed by Korhonen and Koivisto (ANO) for mobile devices. The analysis employed a reduced and merged set of heuristics from these models, suited for the GameBot's context, focusing on (I) usability, (II) gameplay and immersion, and (III) mobility. Regarding the reliability coefficient used to evaluate the survey applied to students after playing the GameBot, Cronbach's Alpha and Guttman Lambda-6 (G6(smc)) coefficients were applied. These metrics were chosen to ensure the internal consistency and reliability of survey items, reflecting on how effectively the questions measured the focuses proposed by the heuristic analysis.

The intricate and nuanced relationships between CT and cognitive variations emphasize the needs to accommodate diverse cognitive profiles when fostering CT skills, recognizing that these cognitive functions can manifest as either strengths or limitations in different students. Consequently, understanding the connections between students’ cognitive functions and CT skills assumes pivotal importance in the design of personalized instructional strategies for CT. Despite a general consideration of learning variability in CT education, empirical insights exploring the correlation between cognitive skills and CT competencies remain notably scarce. This study endeavors to bridge this research gap by investigating the links between executive functions and CT skills, as well as the associations between their sub-dimensions. The results reveal a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.452 between these two domains, underscoring the notable connection between executive functions and CT abilities. Furthermore, the sub-dimensional analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of how specific executive functions uniquely contribute to certain CT skills. In light of these findings, this research offers a promising pathway for the development of tailored CT education programs that can cater to the unique needs of each individual, ultimately facilitating inclusive CT programs and making significant contributions to broaden STEM education and future workforce. © The Author(s) 2024.","computational thinking; data science in education; executive functions; relationships","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189810952"

Recognizing students' computational thinking stages in game-based learning environments is essential to capture unproductive learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. However, few reliable and valid computational thinking measures have been developed, especially in games, where computational knowledge acquisition and computational skill construction are implicit. This study introduced an innovative approach to explore students' implicit computational thinking through various explicit factors in game-based learning, with a specific focus on Zoombinis, a logical puzzle-based game designed to enhance students' computational thinking skills. Our results showed that factors such as duration, accuracy, number of actions and puzzle difficulty were significantly related to students' computational thinking stages, while gender and grade level were not. Besides, findings indicated gameplay performance has the potential to reveal students' computational thinking stages and skills. Effective performance (shorter duration, fewer actions and higher accuracy) indicated practical problem-solving strategies and systematic computational thinking stages (eg, Algorithm Design). This work helps simplify the process of implicit computational thinking assessment in games by observing the explicit factors and gameplay performance. These insights will serve to enhance the application of gamification in K-12 computational thinking education, offering a more efficient method to understanding and fostering students' computational thinking skills. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Game-based learning is a pedagogical framework for developing computational thinking in K-12 education. Computational thinking assessment in games faces difficulties because students' knowledge acquisition and skill construction are implicit. Qualitative methods have widely been used to measure students' computational thinking skills in game-based learning environments. What this paper adds Categorize students' computational thinking experiences into distinct stages and analyse recurrent patterns employed at each stage through sequential analysis. This approach serves as inspiration for advancing the assessment of stage-based implicit learning with machine learning methods. Gameplay performance and puzzle difficulty significantly relate to students' computational thinking skills. Researchers and instructors can assess students' implicit computational thinking by observing their real-time gameplay actions. High-performing students can develop practical problem-solving strategies and exhibit systematic computational thinking stages, while low-performing students may need appropriate interventions to enhance their computational thinking practices. Implications for practice and/or policy Introduce a practical method with the potential for generalization across various game-based learning to better understand learning processes by analysing significant correlations between certain gameplay variables and implicit learning stages. Allow unproductive learning detection and timely intervention by modelling the reflection of gameplay variables in students' implicit learning processes, helping improve knowledge mastery and skill construction in games. Further investigations on the causal relationship between gameplay performance and implicit learning skills, with careful consideration of more performance factors, are expected. © 2024 British Educational Research Association.","computational thinking assessment; data science applications; game-based learning analytics; implicit computational thinking behaviours; learning behaviour patterns","Computer aided instruction; Data Science; Knowledge acquisition; Scaffolds; Behaviour patterns; Computational thinking assessment; Computational thinkings; Data science application; Game-based Learning; Game-based learning analytic; Implicit computational thinking behavior; Learning behavior; Learning behavior pattern; Science applications; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185685680"

Our review focuses on the assessment aspect of CT using digital games. Typically, the assessment in CT is done using Multiple Choice Questions, Portfolio analysis, pen-and-paper methods, and games. The use of video games to assess CT skills was one of the least explored areas. To further explore this area, we did a systematic literature review on the use of video games to assess CT. The findings of our review are as follows: (1) CT skills such as abstraction, algorithmic thinking, data representation, debugging, decomposition, pattern recognition, recursive thinking, simulation, socialization, heuristic, iteration, and problem-solving were primarily assessed using digital games. (2) The reviewed articles used samples ranging from 18 to 3355 participants. (3) The sample includes elementary, middle-, and high-school and graduate students. (4) In the reviewed articles, it is observed that the time for treatment varied from a few hours to the entire school year. (5) A mixed-mode study using quantitative and qualitative methods was preferred by researchers to explore the CT aspects such as CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. (6) The use of video games, stealth assessment, educational data mining and machine learning for assessing CT skills is in a dormant state. (7) There is a lack of empirical evidence to prove that video games are effective to assess CT skills.

Developing a VR-based application in the form of a game for educational purposes necessitates a usability evaluation. This study aims to develop and evaluate usability of a VR game, CT Saber, designed explicitly for learning computational thinking (CT). The name CT Saber is inspired by the popular VR game Beat Saber, with 'CT' denoting computational thinking to emphasize the educational focus of the game. The research employed a Design and Development Research (DDR) approach, encompassing four stages: analysis & definition, design, development, and evaluation. To assess the usability of CT Saber, pilot testing was carried out involving 36 participants (24 male, 12 female) of computer science students aged between 19-22 years. The USE Questionnaire framework was used to evaluate usability, consisting of four variables: usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning, and satisfaction. The evaluation revealed that CT Saber is categorized as 'acceptable' from dichotomous and conventional academic grading perspectives. Similarly, a multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that the independent variables (usefulness, ease of use, and ease of learning) together significantly (p < 0.01) influence the dependent variable (satisfaction). However, only usefulness significantly influences satisfaction. Responses to open-ended questions in the questionnaire also indicated predominantly positive feedback from most participants. Consequently, it can be concluded that the CT Saber VR game developed in this study successfully meets the established criteria for usability. © 2024, Serious Games Society.

The present paper explores the role of key cognitive factors underlying CT performance in non-programming university students. We collected data from 97 non-programming adults in higher education in a supervised setting. Fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and visuospatial ability were assessed using computerized adaptive tests; CT was measured using the Computational Thinking test. The direct and indirect effects of gender and visuospatial ability through fluid intelligence on CT were tested in a serial multiple mediator model. Fluid intelligence predicted CT when controlling for the effects of gender, age, and visuospatial ability, while crystallized intelligence did not predict CT. Men had a small advantage in CT performance when holding the effects of cognitive abilities constant. Despite its large correlation with gender and CT, visuospatial ability did not directly influence CT performance. Overall, we found that programming-naive computational thinkers draw on their reasoning ability that does not rely on previously acquired knowledge to solve CT problems. Visuospatial ability and CT were spuriously associated. Drawing on the process overlap theory we propose that tests of fluid intelligence and CT sample an overlapping set of underlying visuospatial processes. © 2024 Aranyi et al.

For this reason, we designed the ABC-Thinking program for the development of CT in which a set of Bebras tasks were selected and categorised according to the CT skills they were related to, specific lesson plans were designed to integrate these tasks in a 12-week curriculum, and teachers were trained to apply the program. Using the competent Computational Thinking test (cCTt) in a pre-post-test experimental design, we looked to determine whether Primary School students developed specific CT skills after the program, and, therefore, whether Bebras could be considered suitable for the development of this competence.

Moderator analyses revealed which interventions were effective, in which situations, and for what kind of learner. A significant overall mean effect of debugging interventions ((Formula presented.) = 0.64, CI = (0.32, 0.96), p <.001), was found based on 62 effect sizes from 18 source articles. Significant between-studies variation indicated that true effects could range from −0.54 to 1.82. In addition, sensitivity analyses and checks on confounding provided further understandings of intervention features and their impacts. Interventions using enhanced debuggers and systematic instruction were particularly effective in fostering debugging skills. Debugging intervention effects varied by participant population and potentially by publication type. Moreover, debugging interventions had impact regardless of how debugging skills were measured, programming medium used, control-group type, and whether the study was randomized. Future studies should investigate the best practices for improving debugging abilities for whom and under what circumstances. © The Author(s) 2024.","computational thinking; computer science education; debugging; debugging intervention; intervention effect; meta analysis; programming","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182810235"

Using an analysis of scholarly publications based on word co-occurrence, this study aimed to identify the main research themes addressed in the past decade by the scholarly community on game-based teaching and learning solutions in the context of STEM education in secondary schools, their evolution over time, and the key issues addressed in recent years. After a systematic selection, the titles and abstracts of the publications were collected in a text corpus and analyzed using T-LAB software version 7.2.1.4 (2022). A preliminary visual exploration of the keywords was performed to obtain an overall view of the issues addressed by the research. Specificity analysis was then applied to identify, for each subset of the corpus identified by the years of publication, the evolution of themes reflected in a change in the frequency of lemma use. Finally, to explore the most recent topics, the main thematic clusters of publications in the last three years were identified (thematic analysis of elementary contexts). The results suggest some changes in the issues addressed over the past decade, such as a shift in focus from the specific technologies and competitive elements of games to understanding how GBL can support engagement, motivation, and understanding of complex scientific concepts. The five key thematic clusters identified (“Experience”, “Application”, “Validation”, “Emotion”, and “Programming”) also indicate a stronger emphasis by the latest publications on the experiential and emotional components of learning, the need for empirical studies, and the integration of computational thinking and coding into GBL. Overall, this study indicates that GBL has the potential to become an integrated component of STEM education, evolving with pedagogical and technological innovations. © 2024 by the authors.","game-based learning; research trends; secondary STEM education; textual analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196903968"

A valid and reliable measurement tool is needed to develop and evaluate educational practices related to these skills. TechCheck is a validated unplugged assessment of computational thinking skills for young children.

This study aims to adapt and characterize a Turkish version of TechCheck-K for children aged 5–6. Validity and reliability of the Turkish version were established through classical test theory and item response theory, as had been done for the original English language version. Based on classical test theory, the confirmatory factor analysis used A tetrachoric weighted matrix to test the instrument’s structure. The one-dimensional structure of the instrument was verified. The KR-20 reliability coefficient for the scale consisting of one dimension and 15 items was.87, which is considered an acceptable level of reliability. Rasch and 2PL models were compared with M2 statistics to determine the item and test parameters based on item response theory (IRT). The 2PL model was chosen as the best fit. Mean TechCheck scores differed based on gender, socio-economic status, past exposure to computers, and coding experience. These results indicate that the Turkish version of TechCheck-K has acceptable psychometric properties for measuring computational thinking skills in children between 5 and 6 years of age. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Assessment; Computational thinking; Early Childhood; Unplugged coding","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181198911"

Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been introduced as immersive technologies that have the potential to enhance CT skills through more interactive learning experiences. However, there is still a gap in understanding the effectiveness of these technologies in supporting the development of CT, particularly in different levels of education and disciplines. Although several studies have highlighted the benefits of AR and VR in education, no systematic review integrates these findings to identify advantages, challenges, and opportunities for further implementation. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines by analyzing 25 empirical studies (AR=17, VR=8) obtained from the Scopus database (2008-2024). The analysis addresses four key research questions: (1) the current state of AR/VR in CT development, (2) their advantages, (3) implementation challenges, and (4) future research directions. The results show that AR is more widespread than VR at various levels of education, with dominance in higher education followed by secondary and primary schools. Computer science is the main field of application of AR and VR, while AR is also widely applied in mathematics to increase interest and problem-solving. A total of 11 studies reported significant impacts of these technologies on CT, with AR being superior in increasing student motivation and engagement, as well as aiding in problem-solving and debugging. In contrast, VR provides a more immersive learning experience by strengthening concept understanding, especially in programming and recursion. However, several obstacles in the application of AR and VR, such as hardware limitations, costs, and user skills, affect the effectiveness of these technologies in the learning environment. This study also identified potential future research, including the exploration of VR in primary and kindergarten education, the application of VR in non-computer science fields, and the efficient use of these technologies in supporting the CT process. This study provides more precise insights into the optimal ways of utilizing AR and VR in developing CT skills. It is a reference for educators, policymakers, and researchers in supporting CT learning. © The Authors.","Augmented reality; Computational thinking; Education; PRISMA; Systematic review; Virtual reality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011396091"

This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops. The analysis of the posttest further confirmed that the experimental groups (PBL and GBL) exhibited significant difference in the scores compared to the control group.

This field of education primarily comprises two distinct modalities—the block-based programming modality (BPM) and the text-based programming modality (TPM). Previous research may not have provided a complete understanding of the differences between these two modalities as it did not take into account both the learning process and learning outcomes. This study aimed to compare secondary students’ programming behaviors, computational thinking skills, and attitudes toward programming between the two modalities through a quasi-experimental design in a Chinese secondary school. The findings showed that (1) learners in TPM encountered more syntactical errors and spent more time between two clicks of debugging, while learners in BPM had more code-changing behaviors by adjusting programming blocks, made more attempts of debugging, and had more irrelevant behaviors; (2) learners in BPM achieved a higher level of computational thinking skills; (3) learners in both modalities experienced a slight decrease in confidence and enjoyment, while learners in BPM had higher interest levels in programming. (4) Code Changer, Minimal Debugger, Maximal Debugger, Distracted Coder and Average Coder were identified through students’ programming behavior in the two programming modalities, and differences in their CT skills and attitudinal data were revealed.

Although countless efforts have been invested across K-12 education, there is a paucity of research at the postsecondary level about the extent to which CT can contribute to sustainable learning outcomes. Objectives: The current study examines how a series of Arduino-based robotics learning activities capture the fuller essence of concepts related to CT. Methods: College students (n = 50) completed a series of six robotics learning activities. Think-alouds, student reflections and performance scores were used to assess students' CT through a robotics challenge in virtual and physical learning environments. Results and Conclusions: Students verbalized CT concepts related to algorithmic thinking much more than abstraction, problem decomposition and testing and debugging. Students exposed to active learning performed better in a virtual robotics challenge compared to their peers in a traditional-oriented classroom. Students' scores on the physical robotics challenge increased as a function of the number of references they made to CT concepts during the think-alouds. It is possible to design pedagogical experiences that tap into various dimensions of CT at incremental levels of complexity through a series of Arduino-based robotics activities. With the integration of an online simulation, students can visualize and transfer their CT skills between a virtual and physical learning environment, thus leading to more sustainable learning outcomes. © 2023 The Authors.

However, very little has been focused on student learning through game making, especially in science. Moreover, none of the studies on learning through making games has presented an account of how students engage in the process of game design in real time. The present study seeks to address that gap. We report an exploratory embedded case study in which three groups of students in one classroom created a computer game designed to teach peers about climate science, while drawing on scientific knowledge, principles of game design, and computational thinking practices. Data sources were student design sheets, computer video, and audio screen capture while students created their game, and interviews after completing the curriculum unit. A theme-driven framework was used to code the data. A curricular emphasis on systems across climate systems, game design, and computational thinking practices provided a context designed to synergistically supported student learning. This embedded case study provides a rich example of what a collaborative game design task in a constructionist context looks like in a middle school science classroom, and how it supports student learning. Game design in a constructionist learning environment that emphasized learning through building a game allowed students to choose their pathways through the learning experience and resulted in learning for all despite various levels of programming experience. Our findings suggest that game design may be a promising context for supporting student learning in STEM disciplines. © 2023 The Authors.

To address these problems, the use of virtual reality (VR) has been explored as an innovative and potentially effective educational tool. However, so far, the effectiveness of VR applications and the perception of their use lack a clear and effective approach to be used to support education. The importance of addressing this problem lies in the need to improve the quality of teaching using emerging technologies. It is for this reason that it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of teaching using VR. In this context, this research presents the results of the FreeDev application, previously validated with 20 teachers and with 80 engineering students from a private university. FreeDev is a VR application designed to support the teaching of basic programming, it is aimed as an educational tool to provide an immersive experience to students on how to get started in programming and computational thinking. FreeDev has been well accepted, and both teachers and engineering students see it as a tool that can be used to support education.

By integrating CT into other disciplines, the aim is to equip students with essential skills to navigate domain-specific challenges. This study conducts a systematic review of 108 peer-reviewed scientific papers to analyze in which K-12 subjects CT is being integrated, learning objectives, CT integration levels, instructional strategies, technologies and tools employed, assessment strategies, research designs and educational stages of participants. The findings reveal that: (a) over two-thirds of the CT integration studies predominantly focus on science and mathematics; (b) the majority of the studies implement CT at the substitution level rather than achieving a transformation impact; (c) active learning is a commonly mentioned instructional strategy, with block-based languages and physical devices being frequently utilized tools; (d) in terms of assessment, the emphasis primarily lies in evaluating attitudes towards technology or the learning context, rather than developing valid and reliable assessment instruments. These findings shed light on the current state of CT integration in K-12 education. The identified trends provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers seeking to effectively incorporate CT across various disciplines in a manner that fosters meaningful skill development with an interdisciplinary approach. By leveraging these insights, we can strive to enhance CT integration efforts, ensuring the holistic development of students’ computational thinking abilities and promoting their preparedness for the increasingly interdisciplinary domains of digital world. © (2024), (Institute of Mathematics and Informatics).

This paper discusses an approach for bridging the gap between Computational Thinking with Data Science by employing and studying classification as a higher-order thinking process that connects the two. To achieve that, we designed and developed an online constructionist gaming tool called SorBET which integrates coding and database design enabling students to interpret, organize, and analyze data through game play and game design. The paper presents and discusses the results of a pilot study that aimed to investigate the data practices secondary students develop through playing and modifying SorBET games, and to determine the impact of game modding on student critical engagement with CT. According to the results, students developed and used certain data practices such as data interpretation and data model design to become better players or to design an interesting classification game. Moreover, game modding process motivated students to question the original games’ content, leading them to develop a critical stance towards the game data model and representations. © 2024 Vilnius University","computational thinking; computer science education; constructionism; data science; educational technology; empirical study; game-based learning; secondary education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188505037"

However, there was the complexity of technology in supporting learning activities and the gender gap issue, so an appropriate strategy is needed to guide students to achieve the learning goals. In this study, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based robot with the ICAP model was proposed to investigate students’ learning motivation, learning satisfaction, computational thinking, and gender issues while creating AI-based robots in a blended learning environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, this study employed the quasi-experiment. The experimental group students learned with the AI-based robot learning approach with the ICAP model, while the control group students learned with the conventional AI-based robot learning approach. The results showed that the proposed learning approach significantly improved students’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, learning satisfaction, and computational thinking. However, there was no significant interaction between group and gender across all variables. It showed that the ICAP model successfully promoted female students to improve their intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, learning satisfaction, and computational thinking in AI-based robots.

They aspire to design quality systems or games after acquiring related skills but report concerns that programming logic is too difficult to learn because memorization of the syntax is required. Thus, they experience anxiety, are demotivated to learn, and, regretfully, may never enroll in programming courses. Computational thinking (CT) is a favorable method currently used in learning logic. This study proposed an easily implementable standard operating procedure for CT and incorporated it into programming courses; students were instructed and enabled to clarify the logical sequence before beginning to write a program. The standard operating procedure for CT contains five training steps, identify the problem, formulate the problem-solving steps, organize and summarize, draw a flowchart, and write a program. This kind of training can help students clarify the logical order more clearly to facilitate writing programs, thereby improving motivation to learn, reducing learning anxiety, and ultimately improving learning outcomes. The experiment results revealed significant results regarding the learning outcomes, motivation to learn, and learning anxiety of the experimental group learning programming through CT-centered teaching in comparison with those of the group learning through conventional teaching. Additionally, for female students, who were revealed to be initially less capable of logical thinking than male students, the following post intervention improvements were observed: adequate improvement in learning outcomes, increased motivation to learn, and reduced learning anxiety. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computational thinking; Learning anxiety; Learning outcomes; Motivation to learn; Programming","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176585050"

Game-based learning (GBL) may be used to teach CT, and it’s necessary to clarify how to design and implement game-based CT teaching. The literature was systematically searched for empirical studies published between 2011 and 2021. Thirty-nine studies were included in the review and findings suggested that GBL has positive effects on CT, but has non-significant effects on some CT elements (e.g., conditions, triggers, and abstraction) because of limited time to learn these elements and students’ preferences for using CT elements. Game elements, particularly clear goals and rules, progressive challenges, immediate feedback, storyline, avatar, social interaction and various reward mechanisms were used to motivate students to engage in activities to develop CT. Furthermore, single or multiple theoretical foundations, such as constructivist learning theory and experiential learning theory, may guide the design and implementation of game-based activities. Problem-solving, project-based approaches were used to encourage students to use CT to solve problems or complete a project. Finally, guidelines for designing and implementing game-based learning activities for promoting CT were discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.","computational thinking; computational thinking concepts; computational thinking skills; game design; game-based learning; game-play","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168481884"

This study conducted a meta-analysis of 27 empirical studies to examine the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) for fostering students’ CT. The effects of various factors on the learning process for acquiring CT were also examined. The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students’ CT, and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges’ g =.600, 95% CI [.465,.735], p <.001). (b) Furthermore, conducting GBL can improve students’ CT concepts (Hedges’ g =.916, 95% CI [.410, 1.423], p <.001), CT skills (Hedges’ g =.494, 95% CI [.389,.600], p <.001), and CT perspectives (Hedges’ g =.927, 95% CI [.039, 1.816], p <.05). (c) Additionally, game mode, teaching context, and participant characteristics have positive effects on CT. Based on the findings, it is suggested that using more unplugged games and video games, designing collaborative game activities, and tailoring approaches according to gender difference and programming experience can effectively promote CT. The results have significance for fostering students’ CT in GBL; it is further suggested that instruction processes be rationally designed. © The Author(s) 2023.","computational thinking; game mode; game-based learning; meta-analysis; teaching factors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162720208"

A total of 714 K-12 students in China's Zhejiang Province participated in this study and completed an online questionnaire, which included the learning engagement scale and the high-order thinking tendency scale. Cross-sectional survey data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression as a way to examine the relationship between the variables. The results showed that cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, and behavioral engagement were all key factors in developing those students' higher-order thinking for programming learning activities in K-12 students during associated activities. Furthermore, when the students' emotional engagements were elevated, the positive relationships between cognitive engagement, computational thinking, and creative thinking were closer. Inversely, when students' behavioral engagement was high, the positive relationship between cognitive engagement and critical thinking, and the positive relationship between emotional engagement and problem-solving and critical thinking became looser. These results can help deepen educators' understanding of the relationship between learning engagement and higher-order thinking skills to facilitate their search for effective strategies to improve programming instruction.

We planned 8-course periods for 108 curriculums, using the Bebras International Computational Thinking Challenge and programming learning motivation scale to evaluate game-based lessons from Code.org. The grade-3 and -4 students were randomly divided into self-regulation and guided-learning groups, and 153 valid data were analyzed using paired t tests and ANCOVA.

Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Blocky game; Computational thinking; Game-based learning; Student-generated questions strategy; Visual programming","Computer aided instruction; Computer programming; Learning systems; Motivation; Strategic planning; Blocky game; Computational thinkings; Core competencies; Game-based Learning; Higher-order thinkings; Learning platform; Student-generated question strategy; Student-Generated Questions; Thinking skills; Visual programming; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152927935"

As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named ""Play with me in Code"" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Blogs; Constructionism; Creativity; Gamification; Scaffolding; Scratch; Teacher education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151245492"

The potential relationship between computer-based model construction and knowledge transfer has yet to be explored. We studied middle school students who modeled systemic phenomena using the Much.Matter.in.Motion (MMM) platform. A distinct innovation of this work is the complexity-based visual epistemic structure underpinning the Much.Matter.in.Motion (MMM) platform, which guided students' modeling of complex systems. This epistemic structure suggests that a complex system can be described and modeled by defining entities and assigning them (1) properties, (2) actions, and (3) interactions with each other and with their environment. In this study, we investigated students’ conceptual understanding of science, systems understanding, and CT. We also explored whether the complexity-based structure is transferable across different domains. The study employs a quasi-experimental, pretest-intervention-posttest-control comparison-group design, with 26 seventh-grade students in an experimental group, and 24 in a comparison group. Findings reveal that students who constructed computational models significantly improved their science conceptual knowledge, systems understanding, and CT. They also showed relatively high degrees of transfer—both near and far—with a medium effect size for the far transfer of learning. For the far-transfer items, their explanations included entities’ properties and interactions at the micro level. Finally, we found that learning CT and learning how to think complexly contribute independently to learning transfer, and that conceptual understanding in science impacts transfer only through the micro-level behaviors of entities in the system. A central theoretical contribution of this work is to offer a method for promoting far transfer. This method suggests using visual epistemic scaffolds of the general thinking processes we would like to support, as shown in the complexity-based structure on the MMM interface, and incorporating these visual structures into the core problem-solving activities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Complex systems; Computational thinking; Modelling; Science learning; Technology; Transfer of learning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150732735"

In the process of teaching and learning CT, learning strategies and tools play an important role. Efforts have been made to apply several learning strategies for teaching Computational Thinking. Among them, game-based learning and scaffolding are widely adopted. However, more research is needed on how the absence and presence of scaffolding strategies in programming games could affect students' cognitive CT learning gains. This study aims to investigate the effect of scaffolding programming games on the development of middle school students’ CT. In addition, herein we aim to explore the effect of students’ programming attitudes in their CT development. To this end, students were introduced to CT under two distinct experimental conditions: a scaffolding version of a programming game and a non-scaffolding version of the same game. Results report statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-intervention CT scores for all students and statistically significant improvement in learning outcomes in favor of the scaffolding group. In addition, the study hypothesized that attitudes towards programming would have an impact on students’ CT. Although this hypothesis has not been confirmed, the results suggest that students who have a less positive attitude towards programming could particularly benefit from scaffolding aspects in programming games. © 2022, The Author(s).","Computational Thinking; Programming attitudes; Programming Games; Scaffolding","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142375579"

As for adaptive factors; It was determined that adaptations were made for the game, educational content, interface, and non-player character (NPC) behaviors. It is understood that pre-game adaptation and in-game adaptation methods are used as adaptation types. Finally, it is seen that Bayesian networks, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, deep learning, item response theory, and decision tree methods are preferred as decision systems in the adaptation process.

This paper aims at more useful CT assessment. Available evaluation instruments are reviewed; two generally accepted CT evaluation tools are selected for a comprehensive CT assessment: the CTt, a performance test, and the CTS, a self-assessment instrument. The sample comprises 202 high school students from German-speaking Switzerland. Concerning the CTt, Rasch-scalability is demonstrated. Utilizing the approach of the PISA studies, proficiency levels are formed that comprise tasks with specific characteristics that students are systematically able to master. This could help teachers to offer individual support to their students. In terms of the CTS, the original version is refined using confirmatory factor and measurement-invariance analysis. A latent profile analysis yielded four profiles, two of which are of particular interest. One profile comprises students with, on the one hand, moderate to high creative thinking ability, cooperativity, and critical thinking skills and, on the other hand, low algorithmic thinking ability. The second remarkable profile consists of students with particularly low cooperativity. Based on these strength and weakness profiles, teachers could offer support tailored to student needs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Computational thinking; Item response theory; Latent profile analysis; Performance test; Person-centered assessment; Proficiency level model","Computation theory; Computational thinkings; Item response theory; Latent profile analyse; Level model; Performance tests; Person-centered assessment; Proficiency level; Proficiency level model; Profile analysis; Teachers'; Students","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123571557"

The formula of Hedges’ g was used to measure the effect size. The Z test and the Q Cochrane test were also used to analyze the data. The results of this study revealed that the interventions involving computer technology on students’ CT skills had modest positive effect in which computer technology interventions significantly enhanced students’ CT skills. It indicates that the learning process utilizing computer technology is effective to enhance students’ CT skills. Furthermore, educational level, geographical location, group size of intervention, learning tool, and subject did not moderate students’ heterogeneous CT skills. It means that the level of students’ CT skills intervened by using computer technology is not affected by the factors. To improve students’ CT skills, this study suggests teachers to utilize computer technology into their mathematics teaching-learning process.

Understanding how CT skills can be fostered in learning programming concepts through co-creating digital games is crucial to determine instructional strategies that match the young students' interests and capacities. The empirical study has successfully produced a new checklist that can be used as a tool to describe the learning of CT skills when children co-create digital games. The checklist consists of 10 core CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, generalisation, representation, socialisation, code literacy, automation, coordination, and debugging. Thirty-six 10–12 year-olds from sub-urban primary schools in Borneo participated in creating games in three separate eight-hour sessions. In addition, one pilot session with five participants was conducted. The game co-creation process was recorded to identify and determine how these young, inexperienced, untrained young learners collaborated while using CT skills. Analysis of their narratives while co-creating digital games revealed a pattern of using CT while developing the games. Although none of the groups demonstrated the use of all ten CTs, conclusively, all ten components of the CT were visibly present in their co-created digital games. © The Author(s) 2022.","children; co-creation; computational thinking; Digital games development; sub-urban","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141387954"

For this aim, articles containing the term “computational thinking” in the title, keywords and abstract were retrieved by a search on January 18, 2022 from Scopus database. As a result of the search, a total of 1083 articles related to CT published in the Scopus database as of the end of 2021 were obtained. The bibliometric analysis findings of the study showed that there has been a significant increase in the number of publications in this field, especially since 2015. Studies are mostly of United States origin. Although the studies are interdisciplinary, they have been published mainly in journals in the field of educational technologies. The topic modeling analysis showed that the articles in this field were grouped under 13 topics. The first three of these topics, in order of volume, are “Game based learning”, “Programming skills” and “Early child coding”, respectively. When the acceleration of the topics is examined, the first three, whose weight increased over time compared to other topics, came to the fore as “Programming skills”, “Early child coding” and “robotic programming”, respectively.

The principles of constructivism derived from computational thinking provide guidance for the selection of appropriate learning mediums, such as game-based learning, which has gained popularity in education. Game-based learning strongly supports the development of computational thinking. Therefore, this research paper investigates the impact of a gamification strategy on learners' Self-Directed Learning (SDL) within an online learning environment. The study employed a quantitative research methodology, utilizing surveys and performance tests to collect data from 146 participants. The participants' SDL levels were assessed before and after the introduction of gamification elements, including points and badges, in the learning process of different programming languages. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data, including mean values, standard deviations, and minimum and maximum scores. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to assess the significance of the differences in SDL levels. The findings revealed that the learners' SDL levels significantly improved after experiencing the gamified learning environment.

Although DGBL experiences can be beneficial, young children need personalized learning support because they are likely to experience cognitive challenges in computational thinking (CT) development and learning transfer. We implemented the educational game Penguin Go to test our methodological framework to detect children’s optimal learning interaction patterns. Specifically, using SDA, we identified children’s diverse gameplay patterns and inferred their learning states related to CT. To better understand children’s gameplay performance and CT development in context, we used qualitative data as triangulation. We discuss adaptivity design based on the children’s gameplay challenges indicated by their gameplay sequence patterns. This study shows that SDA can inform what in-game support is necessary to foster student learning and when to deliver such support in gameplay.

Studies have broadly investigated the role of coding games in supporting CT learning in formal classroom contexts, but there has been limited exploration of their use in informal home-based settings. This study investigated the factors that motivated students to use a coding game called Coding Galaxy in a home-based setting. It explored the connections between the students’ perceptions of and usage of the tool. An 11-day intervention was conducted at a primary school in Hong Kong with 104 participants. The students’ perceptions of the game were collected via questionnaires and information on their use of the tool was extracted from log files. Results indicated that coding motivation and feeling of enjoyment were predictors of the actual use of the game, with coding motivation the dominant factor. Focus group interviews were also conducted to further explore the students’ motivation to play the game. Through comparisons of active and inactive users, the qualitative findings supported the quantitative results, indicating that students who were more intrinsically motivated tended to be more active in using the game.

This has contributed to a progressive increase in the number of validated and reliable CT assessments for K-12, including primary school. Researchers and practitioners are thus required to choose among multiple instruments, often overlapping in their age validity. Methods: In this study, we compare the psychometric properties of two of these instruments: the Beginners' CT test (BCTt), developed for grades 1–6, and the competent CT test (cCTt), validated for grades 3–4. Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory (IRT) were employed on data acquired from 575 students in grades 3–4 to compare the properties of the two instruments and refine the limits of their validity. Results: The findings (i) establish the detailed psychometric properties of the BCTt in grades 3–4 for the first time, and (ii) through a comparison with students from the same country, indicate that the cCTt should be preferred for grades 3–4 as the cCTt is able to discriminate between students of low and medium ability. Conversely, while the BCTt, which is easier, shows a ceiling effect, it is better suited to discriminate between students in the low ability range. For these grades, the BCTt can thus be employed as a screening mechanism to identify low ability students. Discussion: In addition to providing recomendations for use of these instruments, the findings highlight the importance of comparing the psychometric properties of existing assessments, so that researchers and practitioners, including teachers and policy makers involved in digital education curricular reforms, may take informed decisions when selecting assessments. © © 2022 El-Hamamsy, Zapata-Cáceres, Marcelino, Bruno, Dehler Zufferey, Martín-Barroso and Román-González.","assessment; Computational Thinking; developmental appropriateness; primary school; psychometrics; validation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144950056"

The students had experienced popular speech recognition usage in their daily life, such as Siri and Google Assistant; therefore, this study developed instructional material for university freshmen to learn to develop their own artificial intelligence (AI) application (app) on a smart phone with PAC in MIT App Inventor. The PAC platform and the learning material cultivated students to train their own voice classification model, which is a form of supervised machine learning in the AI domain. The results showed that both groups, who had successfully trained computers to distinguish received voice commands with PAC receiving the human voice spectrogram via the cloud platform developed by MIT, made significant progress in their learning effectiveness in AI education. When the students employed the AI app on smartphones in the CT board game, the students’ voice commands could be classified, and then the corresponding command could be executed through the program to control the action of the robot car on the map, regardless of whether they were competing or not. This study not only successfully provided the students with simple AI learning material, but also cultivated their creative thinking, as identified in the survey of the computational thinking self-efficacy scale. During the process of completing a mobile phone application with AI, students should know and use the function of voice classification to achieve goals and expand their cognition of AI applications.

This study tested the effects of playing a blocked-based programming educational game implemented with in-game cognitive supports on students’ ability to learn and apply computational thinking (CT) skills in near and far transfer tasks. With 79 students randomly assigned to one of two conditions, the control group received basic game supports and the treatment group received cognitive supports in addition to the basic game supports. After two hours of total gameplay over the course of four days, both groups performed equally well, and students’ CT skills were improved significantly at the near transfer level but not at the far transfer level. Students in the control condition performed significantly better on far transfer compared to the students in the treatment condition. Regression analyses indicated that the overall use of the cognitive supports was infrequent, but the amount of time spent voluntarily using cognitive supports with help on goal setting and worked examples predicted far transfer performance. How students use the cognitive supports (subverting the use of cognitive support to conscientiously learn the computational skill by using them more as game cheat sheets) might explain these findings.

Affective factors play a big role in understanding students and their achievements. We can clarify the characteristics and hierarchy of affective factors as affective objectives with a perspective on educational objectives. This systematic review analyzes studies of affective factors in K-12 CE with a perspective on affective objectives. Using a keyword search and inclusion–exclusion criteria, 34 articles were retrieved. Findings show that annual publications are gradually increasing, particularly since 2008. For research purposes, studies for evaluation of inputs and outcomes and designing of teaching methods and educational systems were very common. From the perspective of affective objectives, the tendencies of the articles were analyzed by categorizing Krathwohl's classification into two types (affective activity and cognitive judge activities). Characteristics of each article were evaluated by analyzing the affective objective type, main affective factor type, and research purpose elements. We discussed three things as a result of this review: (1) the amount of research in the affective domain in K-12 CE; (2) study directions from the perspective of affective objectives; and (3) considerations for subject applications. We proposed developing an affective taxonomy suitable for CE as a future work. This review provides a new approach to comprehending the affective domain in K-12 CE and derives trends and implications from the retrieved studies.

Hence, the meaning of abstraction in the context of computational thinking is often confounded, as researchers interpret abstraction through diverse lenses. To disentangle these conceptual threads and gain insight into the operationalisation of abstraction, a systematic review of 96 empirical studies was undertaken. Analysis revealed that identifying features of entities, extracting relevant features, discovering patterns, creating rules and assembling the parts together were the core actions of abstraction. With the primary aim of simplifying practical procedures, abstraction was operationalised as the sophistication of a program, the matching of patterns, the creation of alternative representations, the transfer of solutions, the measurement of a learner’s activity and reading program codes. There is an obvious need for researchers to align the conceptual meanings they have established of abstraction with the practical facts of operationalisation. The need to empirically validate emerging models and the implications for future research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.","abstraction; computational thinking; decomposition; generalisation; problem-solving","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121139259"

In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students' knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students' final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","Coding; Computational thinking practices; Knowledge of computational concepts; Low-income; Middle school; Minecraft","Computer programming; Education computing; Coding; Coding artefacts; Computational thinking practice; Computational thinkings; Knowledge of computational concept; Low incomes; Middle school; Middle school students; Minecraft; Testing and debugging; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127117445"

We developed a set of activities for students to improve and assess essential CT skills by creating real-life applications using Arduino, a microcontroller often used in maker activities. We examined the psychometric features of CT performance assessments with rubrics and the effectiveness of the maker activities on improving CT. Two high school physics teachers implemented these Arduino activities and assessments with fifteen high school students during three days in a summer program.

The participants were 112 third- and fourth-grade students (aged 9–10) who took part in three rounds of experiments. In this paper, we present an iterative problem-solving process in design-based implementation research, focusing on the implementation issues that lead to the design principles in the mathematics classroom. The computational tasks, environment, tools, and practices were iteratively improved over three rounds to incorporate CT effectively into mathematics. Results from the CT questionnaire demonstrated that the new program could significantly improve students’ CT abilities and compound thinking. The results of the post-test revealed that CT, including the sub-dimensions of decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving improved threefold compared to the pre-test between the three rounds, indicating that strengthened CT design enhanced CT perceptions. Similarly, the students’ and teacher’ interviews confirmed their positive experiences with CT.

In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills.

The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness. © 2021","ACT-R; Cognitive architectures; Mental rotation; Serious games design; TetrisTM","Rotation; Serious games; ACT-R; Cognitive architectures; Computational cognitive modeling; Critical thinking; Gameplay; Human cognition; Mental rotation; Serious games designs; Spatial reasoning; TetrisTM; Chemical activation; article; cognitive model; human; human experiment; learning; rotation; skill","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122683826"

The purpose is to understand students’ perceived competence to use computational thinking effectively, along with their computer programming learning attitude regarding the C++ programming language for one semester (2 hours per week, 36 total learning hours). A total of 495 students specializing in the medical field participated in the study. Structural equation models were constructed according to three adapted scales: the computer programming learning attitude scale, the computational thinking perspectives scale, and the programming empowerment scale. The computer programming learning attitude scale is based on three factors: willingness, negativity, and necessity. The computational thinking perspectives scale also considers three factors: the ability to express, the ability to connect, and the ability to question. The programming empowerment scale is composed of four factors: meaningfulness, impact, creative self-efficacy, and programming self-efficacy. The results showed that a positive learning attitude will positively affect computational thinking perspectives and programming empowerment. However, when students have a negativity attitude, feeling that they are being forced to learn the C++ programming language, their computational thinking perspectives and programming empowerment will be negatively affected.

This study aims to improve the efficiency of cluster randomized trials on computer/information literacy and computational thinking. The study employs a two-level hierarchical linear model to estimate (i) intraclass correlation coefficients, (ii) the amount of explained variances given selected predictors, and (iii) minimum detectable effect sizes given the set of plausible scenarios. Two data cycles from the International Computer and Information Study were used. The covariates at the student level are gender, interest in ICT, parents’ highest education level, ICT self-efficacy, and experience with computers. The covariates at school/teacher level are teacher’s ICT use, ratio of school size to the number of computers for student use, availability of ICT resources at school, approximate teacher age, and ICT self-efficacy. Findings showed that the most precise effect could be measured when student and teacher/school covariates are both adopted. Lastly, it was revealed that increasing the number of schools is effective to get the most precise effect. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cluster randomized trials; Computational thinking; Computer and information literacy; ICILS; Power analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122822774"

While several researchers have explored the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in serious games, many of these games have not been critically explained or evaluated. To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players’ qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity.

Despite this growing interest, research on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of method to assess students’ CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary school students’ understanding of CT concepts, computational problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the 5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges of the 5E-based FCM are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.","5E instructional framework; computational thinking; elementary education; flipped classroom","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112224743"

Typical simplification strategies are outlined, and according to our findings CT courses for non-technical students typically address learners from different faculties, providing generic and basic knowledge, not specifically related to their major. In this study, we propose instead a hermeneutic approach to simplify programming, in which we aim at clarifying the problem-solving aspect of programming, addressing computational problems that are specific to their studies and leveraging on learners’ preunderstanding of the digital media they have experienced as users. The practical counterpart of our theoretical approach is a minimalistic Python multimedia library, called Medialib, that we designed to enable university students with a non-technical profile to create visual media and games with short and readable code. We discuss the use of Medialib in two empirical case studies: a collaboration with the university of Kyushu in Fukuoka, Japan, and a coding module for Media Studies students at the University of Southern Denmark. Furthermore, we use Notional Machines to attempt a comparison of the simplicity of learning tools for programming, and to ground our claim that Medialib is “simpler” for learners than other popular approaches. The main contribution is a hermeneutic approach to the simplification of programming for specific contexts that combines the hermeneutic spiral and notional machines. The approach is supported by a tool, the Medialib library; the two case studies provide examples of how the approach and tool can be deployed in beginners in CT courses. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.","Computational Thinking; Hermeneutic; Learn programming; Notional Machines; Simplification","Digital storage; Python; Computational thinkings; Hermeneutic; Hermeneutic approaches; Learn programming; Learn+; Notional machine; Problem-solving; Simplification; Technical universities; University students; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123083740"

However, a systematic review that specifically discusses game based in VR (GBiVR) settings is lacking. This paper reports previous studies systematically about the strategies used to learn CT through games and VR applications. 15 papers were selected through Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Data from 70 students aged 11–12 were analysed using factorial multivariate analysis of covariance and analysis of covariance. Our findings revealed that while effective in fostering conceptual knowledge of CT (such as sequence, loop, and conditional), the conventional technology-enhanced learning approach falls short when it comes to promoting CT skills (such as pattern recognition and debugging). The game approach, however, could simultaneously promote CT skills and conceptual knowledge, leading to improvement in the overall knowledge of CT. Additional analysis showed that learners with different prior knowledge and learning attitudes made a higher improvement using the adaptive game in terms of skills, conceptual knowledge, and overall knowledge of CT, especially for medium and lower prior knowledge learners that did not have a very high prior learning attitude. Consequently, to promote CT in primary school students, educators can employ computer game approaches that not only can foster both skills and conceptual knowledge of CT but also more effectively assist students with lower prior learning attitudes and knowledge. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","","Computer games; Multivariant analysis; Pattern recognition; Regression analysis; Students; Analysis of covariances; Computational thinkings; Conceptual knowledge; Educational computer game; Learning attitudes; Multi variate analysis; Power Point presentations; Technology enhanced learning; Learning systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107573945"

Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode.

Following a STEAM approach, the workshop aimed to engage participants in age-appropriate activities that focus on CT skills through the lens of creating their own game. A web-based game design interface that allows students to code and play games as simulated on a skyscraper was developed to support the workshop's core activities. The web environment also featured step-by-step tutorials and fully functional games to promote the accessibility of the learning materials for a diverse body of students and educators around the globe. The results of the study indicated that the workshop helped students improve their CT skills and differentially influence their attitudes towards computing. In particular, the workshop experience led students from underserved community districts to lower their attitude ratings, whereas the reverse pattern was observed for students from more affluent districts. The workshop reportedly informed students' perception of computing as a profession and their appreciation of the analytical effort required for developing functional games.

Prior research has shown numerous interdisciplinary benefits related to CT, however, these influential factors have often been investigated with relatively few variables. This study investigated factors that may lead to 4th and 5th grade elementary school students’ development of computational thinking skills in collaborative robotics activities by hypothesizing a model which proposed that a problem solving inventory, intrinsic motivation, and enjoyment were the main predictors of computational thinking skills. The model was then tested by surveying students with several psychometric inventories where a revised model was then constructed. The study found significant relationships between perceived competence and enjoyment, and learning motivation, and intrinsic motivation. Another important finding was that problem solving was a significant predictor of computational thinking skills. Results were interpreted with reference to implications for possible means of improving learning outcomes when using collaborative robotics in an educational setting. © The Author(s) 2021.","collaborative robotics; computational thinking skills; elementary school; enjoyment; intrinsic motivation; learning preferences; perceived competence; problem solving inventory; robotics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100567356"

The typologies of motivations from a user-gratification perspective were explored from live coding streaming platforms such as “Twitch.tv” and “LiveEdu.tv”. Categories of motivations were identified from the literature. Content analysis was used for analyzing the distribution of motivation categories in “Twitch.tv,” as well as blog posts on “LiveEdu.tv” guided by Gratifications Theory. From the literature, five types of motivations were identified: 1) Cognitive; 2) Affective; 3) Social Integration; 4) Personal Integration; and 5) Tension release. In live coding streaming communities, the content analysis of 256 streams and twenty six discussion posts indicated that the primary motivation is cognitive related information seeking, followed by social integration such as community outreach, and then personal integration such as personal recognition. Through content analysis, the authors found that the audience's psychological state while watching online livestreaming of coding practice is mainly focused on learning and information seeking, emotional connectedness, and social interactions. Based on the findings, an empirical motivation model in live coding streaming was also developed. The findings for researchers and practitioners alike in programming education can apply respective motivation characteristics in programming education. © ACPIL.","Computational thinking; Computer science education; Game-based learning; Live coding; Online communities; Streaming","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120161236"

First, we aim to provide a systematic map of the relevant research by identifying the areas and sub-areas of CT through programming teaching and learning in higher education. Second, we aim to investigate these areas based on two dimensions: their evolution over the years and the branches to which CT is applied. For this purpose, we apply a systematic mapping methodology. Main results include the identification of the CT areas of Knowledge Base, Assessment, Learning Strategies, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building. Of these, Knowledge Base, Assessment and Tools have significantly evolved throughout the years, while Capacity Building has only recently emerged. In addition, the introduction of CT to undergraduate students and preservice teachers differs mainly in the tools used and the CT elements that are assessed.

Unfortunately, these concepts can be difficult for novice students to understand. One way students can develop CT skills is to involve them in the design of an application to teach CT. This study focuses on co-designing mini games to support teaching and learning CT principles and concepts in an online environment. Online co-design (OCD) of mini games enhances students’ understanding of problem-solving through a rigorous process of designing contextual educational games to aid their own learning. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face co-designing between researchers and stakeholders could be difficult, OCD is a suitable option. CS students in a Nigerian higher education institution were recruited to co-design mini games with researchers. Mixed research methods comprising qualitative and quantitative strategies were employed in this study. Findings show that the participants gained relevant knowledge, for example, how to (i) create game scenarios and game elements related to CT, (ii) connect contextual storyline to mini games, (iii) collaborate in a group to create contextual low-fidelity mini game prototypes, and (iv) peer review each other’s mini game concepts. In addition, students were motivated toward designing educational mini games in their future studies. This study also demonstrates how to conduct OCD with students, presents lesson learned, and provides recommendations based on the authors’ experience. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computational thinking; Game-based learning; Mini games; Nigeria; Online co-design; Smart learning environments; Virtual reality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105432839"

Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving skill which can motivate students’ English language learning. Designing a learning activity which integrates CT into English language learning has been considered in only a few academic studies. This study aimed to explore whether integrating CT into English language learning can be useful for improving learners’ motivation and performance. The method of “present, practice, and produce” was applied as a method of presenting computational thinking in the English language learning classroom. Fifty-two elementary school students (52) participated in the experimental study. Following an experimental design, data were collected and analyzed from a combination of knowledge test scores, storytelling, motivation, and anxiety surveys. The experimental results indicate that the CT strategy improves students’ language learning and raises their motivation in the two dimensions of extrinsic and intrinsic goal orientation. These results imply the positive effect of CT strategy on strengthening problem-solving skills of students participating in digital storytelling and increases their motivation and performance in English language learning. © The Author(s) 2020.","anxiety; computational thinking; digital storytelling; motivation; scratch","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094673763"

Moreover, there is a lack of integration of adaptivity into educational computer games for computational thinking, which is crucial to addressing individual needs in developing computational thinking skills. In this study, we present an adaptive educational computer game, called AutoThinking, for developing students’ computational thinking skills in addition to their conceptual knowledge. To evaluate the effects of the game, we conducted an experimental study with 79 elementary school students in Estonia, where the experimental group learned with AutoThinking, while the control group used a traditional technology-enhanced learning approach. Our findings show that learning with the adaptive educational computer game significantly improved students’ computational thinking related to both conceptual knowledge and skills.

We explore students’ activities with a tool integrating constructionist textual programming activity with game-based learning and specifically game modding. In this context, we designed a programmable ‘design-to-play’ game developed with the computational environment MaLT2. MaLT2 offers the affordances of textual programming, dynamic manipulation, and 3D navigation for the design of 3D animated models aiming to give children access to, otherwise, complex, computational and mathematical ideas. To develop an understanding of children's learning activity regarding computational practices, we organised an empirical study with middle-school students, who played a game called ‘Code-the-Mime’. It is a charades-based game in which the players manipulate, programme, and modify a digital human model to describe a word to their teammates. The preliminary findings indicate that the affordances of MaLT2 in conjunction with the game context enabled students to express and develop key computational practices, including decomposition, pattern recognition, analysis and abstraction, in a meaningful and multidisciplinary context. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Computational Thinking is considered a key 21st-century skill in preparing the young to become digital citizens. It involves concepts and practices that can be used to solve problems computationally across multiple fields. However, there is still limited knowledge of how students develop computational practices, such as abstraction, pattern recognition, decomposition, and how they may express and apply them in diverse contexts. Students’ engagement with computational practices is unlikely to be supported either by closed, simplified coding tasks or higher-level advanced programming exercises. There is a need to clarify the manifestation of these practices and how they can be realised and expressed and used by learners in meaningful and transdisciplinary contexts. What this paper adds It suggests the design of constructionist computational games that integrate design and programming into the gameplay, aiming to engage students with computational practices in a multidisciplinary, authentic context. It provides an example of a ‘design-to-play’ charades-like game, developed in a 3D modelling programming environment, that embeds real-life representations into computational design, to enable ‘syntonic learning’ of computational practices. Furthermore, it analyses student learning activity to elaborate on arguments and issues related to this approach. Implications for practice and/or policy There is added value in disconnecting computational thinking from positivist diagnostic approaches related to respective concepts and studying it in ways more related to realistic problem-solving situations and multidisciplinary contexts. The study contributes to the scientific clarification of computational practices concerning how they are being realised and expressed by the students in different contexts through an original example of educational practice. The discussed approach and tools can contribute to the design and development of innovative digital media, embedding affordances for concepts and practices while maintaining relevance and interest for their users. © 2021 British Educational Research Association","3D geometry; computational thinking; constructionism; constructionist game; game-based learning","3D modeling; Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Pattern recognition; Students; Computational design; Computational environments; Computational thinkings; Design and Development; Digital human modeling; Middle school students; Programming activities; Programming environment; Three dimensional computer graphics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107011708"

Two teacher educators recently implemented a series of readings and activities in their methods courses designed to help preservice teachers sophisticate their conceptions of texts beyond autonomous, neutral collections of information by considering digital age ideas such as software theory, textual ideology, and the algorithmic bias of the Internet. The authors review recent scholarship surrounding the integration of computational thinking and the humanities before illustrating a theoretical framework that combines software-driven interpretation and critical media literacy. Descriptions and applications of course texts and exercises precede a discussion on typological methodology. Through the analysis of semester-long writing reflections and course interactions, a typology of preservice teachers is then presented, illustrating three archetypes: Strategists, Hawkeyes, and Improvers. These archetypes are taken up to analyze the ways in which a range of teacher candidates considered ontological notions of digital texts to analyze instructional techniques, to sharpen their critical lenses, or to gain greater understanding of ELA as a discipline (or some combination of all three). This work demonstrates that as teacher educators and teacher candidates increasingly consider software-powered literacies, interrogations of who we are, who we are becoming, and what it all means requires attention to, and explicit practice with, the dark side of digital texts. © The Author(s) 2020.","critical media literacy; Digital literacies; digital texts; English language arts; software theory; teacher education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097560052"

The current study analyzes keywords, co-authorship, and cited publications in digital literacy through the scientometric method. The journal articles have been retrieved from the WoS (Web of Science) using four keywords: ""Digital literacy,""""ICT literacy,""""information literacy,""and ""media literacy.""Further, keywords, publications, and co-authorship are examined and further classified into clusters for more in-depth investigation. Digital literacy is a multidisciplinary field that widely embraces literacy, ICT, the Internet, computer skill proficiency, science, nursing, health, and language education. The participants, or study subjects, in digital literacy research range from primary students to professionals, and the co-authorship clusters are distinctive by countries in America and Europe. This paper analyzes one fixed chunk of a dataset obtained by searching for all four keywords at once. Further studies will retrieve the data from diverse disciplines and will trace the change of the leading research themes by time spans. To shed light on the findings, using customized digital literacy curriculums and technology is critical for learners at different ages to nurture digital literacy according to their learning aims. They need to cultivate their understanding of the social impact of exploiting technology and computational thinking. To increase the originality of digital literacy-related studies, researchers from different countries and cultures may collaborate to investigate a broader range of digital literacy environments.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results revealed that the scale which consisted of three factors (mathematics, science and information technology) could sufficiently measure primary school students' STEM learning attitude in the current sample. In Study 2, we explored the association between students' STEM learning attitude and their CT skills. Evidence revealed that learning attitude towards STEM significantly predicted CT skills.

This paper contributes to CT research by investigating CT predictors among upper secondary students in a longitudinal and natural classroom setting.

CT is measured with the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), an established performance test. N = 202 high-school students, at three time points over one school year, act as the sample and latent growth curve modeling as the analysis method. CT self-concept, followed by reasoning skills and gender, show the strongest association with the level of CT. Computer literacy, followed by duration of computer use and formal learning opportunities during the school year, have the strongest association with CT growth. Variables from all three areas seem to be important for predicting either CT level or growth. An explained variance of 70.4% for CT level and 61.2% for CT growth might indicate a good trade-off between the comprehensiveness and parsimony of the conceptual framework.

GBL and CT concept components are obtained through analysis of previous research and specialist consultancy. The method of analytical analysis consists of three phases i.e. planning, implementation and documentation. This analysis started on March to May 2020 and involved 398 articles related to GBL and CT. However, there are only fifteen articles on the development element of the GBL application and eight articles related to the CT concept were used. During an expert consultancy, fifteen specialists was involved in various backgrounds and experience in GBL and CT. The result shows that there are six main elements and 21 sub-elements of GBL. 6 main elements consist of rules, objectives, feedback, interactions, challenges and narrative. Mean-while, the sub-element consists of the operating rules, basic rules, explicit rules and behaviours, measures, goals, gamification purposes, marks, re-wards, badges/awards, player charts, characters, consequences, constraints, levels of games, fun, competition, control, space, engagement and curiosity that have been matched with their main elements. The main element and sub-element of the GBL is called GBL component. Each of these GBL components is integrated with seven concepts of CT i.e. decomposition, algorithm, abstraction, logical reasoning, assessment, evaluation, pattern recognition and automation. © 2021","computational thinking; design model; game-based learning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119447319"

Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards. © 2013 IEEE.","Computational thinking; early ages; game learning analytics; interests; intrinsic motivation; learn to program; persistence; rewards; skills; video games","Motivation; Academic performance; Age groups; Computational thinkings; Early age; Game-Based; Gender differences; Intrinsic motivation; Video game; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114730089"

However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach’s alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide. © The Author(s) 2021.","algorithm; artificial intelligence; computational thinking; psychometric assessment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112752158"

Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games. © 2013 IEEE.","block-based maze game; Computational thinking; difficulty; educational games","Fuzzy inference; Adaptive learning; Block based; Computational thinkings; Educational game; Log data; Personalized learning; Student performance; Students","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104655181"

The references were then analysed using NVivo software to code them according to several main points. Based on the literature review, there are many benefits of computational thinking in education, including increasing critical and analytical thinking among students, cultivating CT skills in STEM education among students, improving pedagogy and curriculum, and fostering CT skills through game-based learning (GBL). However, there are some challenges facing the implementation of computational thinking in the field of education. These include teachers’ understanding of computational CT, lack of confidence, lack of the skills required to implement CT, and students’ acceptance of CT. In order to overcome these challenges, there are two important aspects to consider: ensuring teachers’ level of knowledge and level of readiness about CT is high. It is hoped that this literature review will be able to provide educators with an understanding of the extent to which CT is able to shape education to be more creative and meaningful. © 2021 by the authors.","Benefits; Computational thinking; CT; Education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103814824"

To evaluate the possible effects of the game, an experimental study was carried out with 79 students in an elementary school in Estonia. AutoThinking and a conventional technology-enhanced learning approach were used for teaching CT to the experimental and control group, respectively. Our results reveal that AutoThinking improved students’ CT skills and conceptual knowledge better than the conventional approach.

Though previous works have proposed different models and frameworks to describe the underlying concepts of CT, very few have discussed how ER activities should be implemented in classrooms to effectively foster CT skill development. Particularly, there is a lack of operational frameworks, supporting teachers in the design, implementation, and assessment of ER activities aimed at CT skill development. The current study therefore presents a model that allows teachers to identify relevant CT concepts for different phases of ER activities and aims at helping them to appropriately plan instructional interventions. As an experimental validation, the proposed model was used to design and analyze an ER activity aimed at overcoming a problem that is often observed in classrooms: the trial-and-error loop, i.e., an over-investment in programming with respect to other tasks related to problem-solving. Results: Two groups of primary school students participated in an ER activity using the educational robot Thymio. While one group completed the task without any imposed constraints, the other was subjected to an instructional intervention developed based on the proposed model. The results suggest that (i) a non-instructional approach for educational robotics activities (i.e., unlimited access to the programming interface) promotes a trial-and-error behavior; (ii) a scheduled blocking of the programming interface fosters cognitive processes related to problem understanding, idea generation, and solution formulation; (iii) progressively adjusting the blocking of the programming interface can help students in building a well-settled strategy to approach educational robotics problems and may represent an effective way to provide scaffolding. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide initial evidence on the need for specific instructional interventions on ER activities, illustrating how teachers could use the proposed model to design ER activities aimed at CT skill development. However, future work should investigate whether teachers can effectively take advantage of the model for their teaching activities. Moreover, other intervention hypotheses have to be explored and tested in order to demonstrate a broader validity of the model. © 2020, The Author(s).","Computational thinking; Educational robotics; Instructional intervention; Problem solving; Trial-and-error","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088860972"

Even without these limitations, Scratch users often produce code with ‘code smells’ such as duplicate blocks and long scripts which impact how they understand and debug projects. These code smells can be removed using procedural abstraction, an important concept in computer science rarely taught to this age group. This article describes the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which concentrates on how procedural abstraction is introduced and reinforced. The article then reports an extended evaluation to measure the game’s efficacy with children aged 10 and 11, finding that children who played the game were then able to use procedural abstraction in Scratch. The article then uses game analytics to explore why the game was effective and gives three recommendations for educational game design based on this research: using learning trajectories and restrictive success conditions to introduce complex content, increasing learner investment through customisable avatars and suggestions for improving the evaluations of educational games. © The Author(s) 2020.","block-based programming; computational thinking; computer science education; game design; game-based learning; Pirate Plunder; procedural abstraction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086784205"

In this paper, we explore the theoretical connection between STEM and emergent technologies, with a focus on learner behaviors and the potential of technology-mediated experiences with computational participation (CP) in shaping STEM learning. In particular, by de-emphasizing what technology is used and bringing renewed focus to how the technology is used, we make a case for CP as an epistemological and pedagogical approach that promotes collaborative STEM practices. Utilizing Ihde's work as a conceptual framework, we explore how technology-mediated relations shape STEM learner experiences and behaviors by empowering learners to develop scientific knowledge through collaborative participation and interactive relationships with technology. In particular, we focus on technology mediated game-based learning and citizen science, and examine how CP creates opportunities for STEM learners to leverage learning with technology in innovative ways. We argue that through computational and collaborative learning experiences, learners participate as members of STEM learning communities in ways that mirror how STEM professionals collaborate, applying interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to complex real-world problems. Computational participation consequently creates opportunities for learner-technology pairings to (re)shape STEM learning behaviors, empowering learners to engage collaboratively as members of a STEM community of practice. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","citizen science; collaborative learning; community of practice; computational participation; computational thinking; game-based learning; learner-technology; STEM education; STEM practices; technology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090960541"

The goal of this paper is to find out why it is important to teach programming in school. The main questions about this issue are: what are the reasons to teach programming? What are the main problems in the teaching process? How to teach programming? Answers to these questions are not always connected with each other and the teachers, who really create education in the classroom, need much more precise and complete information to what to teach and how to teach. Because of these issues, we decided to research this field and share our own experience, which we believe is successful in our school: we teach programming through the projectbased learning method. Using this method, it is possible to develop 21st century skills and teach the basics of computer science from elementary school. In this paper we will discuss about secondary school students; by the end of the project, the 10th grade students have solved one of the problems of the school community - they have created educational games on the topic of ecology; games were created by the request of elementary school teachers; this year the games are successfully used in learning process. © 2020 International Journal of Learning and Teaching.

Gaming and interactivity have been suggested as essential features in reducing dropout and increasing persistence in online learning. Yet in interactive game-based learning environments, persistence in moving forward in the game may come at the expense of investing in each of the game’s levels. That is, the motivation to complete the game may have a deleterious effect on learning at specific levels and hence on learning from the game in general. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on microlevel persistence (i.e., persistence during each component of the learning process). We study microlevel persistence in the context of acquiring computational thinking—the thought process of solving problems through abstraction—which is a key component of the new literacies needed for tomorrow’s citizens. In this study, we analyze data collected from an online, game-based learning environment (CodeMonkey™). The data document the activity of first to sixth graders (N = 2,040). Overall, we find that persistence is positively associated with difficulty and that the most determined learners were highly persistent across topics in achieving the best solution. © The Author(s) 2019.","computational thinking; computer-aided instruction; elementary school; game-based learning; learning analytics; log analysis; persistence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075184995"

The revival of board gameplay has been discussed in mainstream media, and has drawn the attention of researchers. Yet, in the field of games studies, the conception of games as learning spaces is mostly emphasized through digital/video games. Aim: This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners. Results: Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity. Conclusion: The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games. © The Author(s) 2020.","board games; diversity; game studies; learning; literature review; objective","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083514775"

Across the studies, the analyses pursue two themes: (a) the role of agent-based modeling as a synergistic local practice around which we can integrate computational thinking and scientific modeling within digital games and (b) the role of collaboration in leveraging those synergies. We then present a design of a disciplinarily-integrated game that integrates these themes to demonstrate one such possible instantiation of the themes. Finally, we discuss the implications for design and praxis with a particular focus on learning in classrooms across the curriculum. Specifically, we first explore the implications in terms of connecting to teachers’ views of practice by framing computational modeling and computational thinking as mathematization. We then explore the implications of shifting from a focus on single players to communities of practice in terms of computational participation as science as practice. We close by exploring the pragmatic and pedagogical affordances of shifting from stand-alone single-topic games to flexible agent-based environments in terms of student development across the curriculum. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Computational thinking; digital games; disciplinary integration; modeling; science as practice; science education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068668921"

We present the results of a quasi-experimental piece of research with sixth-grade students which studies the influence of Scratch both on the acquisition of mathematical concepts, and on the development of computational thinking. The experiment consisted of two different phases, a programming phase linked to the instruction in Scratch and focused on the acquisition of basic concepts of computational thinking (sequences, iterations, conditionals, and events-handling), and a mathematical phase completely oriented towards the resolution of mathematical tasks. In particular, the mathematical phase focused on word problems whose resolution involves the use of the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor. In order to evaluate the aims of the study, results from tests before and after instruction, both in computational thinking and in the mathematical standards, were compared.

Through research in K-2 classrooms on computational thinking, we noticed that students lack the representational fluency needed to move from one form to another—such as moving from physical to more abstract representations. Therefore, the following research question was studied: How do second-grade students use and translate among representations to solve computational thinking tasks using the robot mouse game? To address this, we employed a task-based interview approach with three second-grade students who were engaged in four computational thinking tasks using the Code and Go Robot Mouse Coding Activity Set developed by Learning Resources. Through four clinical tasks involving the robot mouse, students solved puzzles set up to force them to make particular representational translations. Each translation involved a level of cognitive complexity the students needed to manage to successfully complete the task. We found that students translated between many different representations using concrete representations to ease translations, language as a scaffold between translations, and embodied movements as representations or to assist with translation. Furthermore, the levels of representational maturity showed by the students varied with the difficulty of the task, and the spatial orientation was particularly difficult for them. These results provide important insights into how learners may develop their ability to engage with abstract representations that will be part of future practices associated with activities in science, mathematics, engineering, and computational thinking. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Computational thinking; early elementary; representational fluency; representations","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079700774"

Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses. © 2013 IEEE.","Computational thinking; computer programming; game-based learning; gamification; serious games; video game design","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151110817"

Bandura defines self-efficacy as awareness of the individual’s potential and capabilities to accomplish a goal. Teaching efficacy beliefs is a significant identifier of teachers’performance and motivation in teaching the specific content successfully; however, K-12 science teachers’ CT teaching efficacy beliefs are rarely discussed. Participating preservice elementary teachers (PSET) were enrolled in an undergraduate elementary science teaching methods course during the spring and summer 2018 semesters in a southwestern state university. We administered a CT teaching efficacy beliefs survey at the beginning and end of the related unit (i.e., the intervention). During the intervention, the PSETfollowed the CTpractices by building educational robots, coding visual block-based programs, and solving puzzles in the video game “Zoombinis.” In this paper, we report the impact of the intervention on teaching efficacy beliefs of PSET. We used SPSS software to analyze our quantitative results. We performed paired samples t-test for the two teaching efficacy beliefs subscales, Personal Computational Thinking Teaching Efficacy (PCTTE) and Computational Thinking Teaching Outcome Expectancy (CTTOE), to measure if there is a significant difference in teaching efficacy beliefs. Our research findings suggest that introducing CT increases PSET CT teaching efficacy beliefs.

A resource pack consisting of various activities using MIT App Inventor 2 was created which incorporated constructivist approaches to teaching. This resource pack was reviewed by the teachers and their feedback was collected by means of a case study. The teachers agreed that developing mobile-based games would be highly stimulating to their students but there were uncertainties how this would affect students with different learning abilities and due to a general lack of computational thinking and problem-solving skills by most students. © 2020.

In this context, the ""Riconnessioni"" project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow's digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called ""cascade training"", the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers' and students' skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers' competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

For example, in Malaysia, a number of efforts have been pursued to develop strong computational thinking among school students through the implementation of learning activities that nurture such a skill in most of the school subjects. However, previous studies have shown that teachers have a low understanding and misconception about the concept of computational thinking, which could derail such efforts. Furthermore, the lack of studies focusing on motivating students to actively participate in the learning process is further compounding such a predicament. Premised on this context, this study was carried out to examine the impact of cooperative learning on the development of CT skill among a group of 25 Year-3 students, aged 9, which was carried out based on three learning approaches, namely student-centric, hands-on, and inquiry-based approaches. Through such learning, which took place at one private school located in Selangor, Malaysia, the students learned four learning concepts related to a topic of a science subject. In this study, the researcher played the role of a teacher by teaching these students the learning concepts using a lesson plan designed based on the three learning approaches. The methodology used to collect data was based on a class observation and an interview with the science teacher. The analysis of the qualitative data revealed that students were highly engaged and participative in the learning process and were able to learn the scientific concepts of the subject matter with greater efficacy, which was indicative of their improved CT skill. As such, these findings underscore the imperative of developing and nurturing computational thinking among students, with which students would be able to solve complex problems more effectively ©©2020 by authors, all rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Cooperative Learning; Hands-on Learning Approach; Inquiry-based Learning Approach; Learning Concepts; Problem Solving; Student-centric Approach","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078007546"

However, CT learning is perceived as a time-consuming and frustrating experience by many K-12 and university students. Hence, educators are coming up with various methodologies to make CT both accessible and engaging for learners, thus leading to a spurt in various game-based learning (GBL) approaches in this field, ranging from board games to educational robotic games. This paper strives to evaluate tabletop escape games as a potential tool to develop CT as a competency among K-12 learners and the assessment of its effectiveness in achieving the learning outcomes. To do this, the authors conducted a literature review of existing papers on tabletop games that use the theme of an escape game to develop and assess CT as a competency. Based on a systematic analysis of the existing literature, they conducted an analytical review of three papers on tabletop games in CT to identify the CT components being developed, the evaluation methods explained in them, the current limitations faced by the authors of these three papers and the possible ways to circumvent such limitations. This paper also covers the design aspects to be considered for the development of a CT-based educational escape game to support and evaluate this competency and its components. © 2019, Serious Games Society.

One such design practice, widespread in the design and arts fields, is critique. This paper explores the role of critique in two urban, heterogenous 8th grade science classrooms in which students engaged in creating computer games on the topic of climate systems and climate change. It explores and compares how practices of critique resulted from curricular decisions to (i) scaffold intentional critique sessions for student game designers and (ii) allow for spontaneous feedback as students interacted with each other and their games during the process of game creation. Results: Although we designed formal opportunities for critique, the participatory dimension of the project meant that students were free to critique each other’s games at any time during the building process and did so voluntarily. Data indicate that students focused much more on the game play dimension of the design than the science, particularly in those critique sessions that were student-initiated. Despite the de-emphasis on science in spontaneous critiques, students still focused on several dimensions of computational thinking, considering user experience, troubleshooting, modeling, and elegance of solutions. Conclusions: Students making games about science topics should have opportunities for both formal and spontaneous critiques. Spontaneous critiques allow for students to be authorities of knowledge and to determine what is acceptable and what is not. However, formal, teacher-designed critiques may be necessary for students to focus on science as part of the critique. Furthermore, one of the benefits to critiquing others was that students were able to see what others had done, how they had set up their games, the content they included, and how they had programmed certain features. Lastly, critiques can help facilitate iteration as students work to improve their games. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; Computational thinking; Critique; Game design; Middle school; Participatory pedagogy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076217857"

In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Children; Coding; Computational thinking; Constructionism; Design-based research; Engagement","Behavioral research; Human computer interaction; Children; Coding; Computational thinkings; Constructionism; Design-based research; Engagement; Codes (symbols); adolescent; article; artifact; child; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; motivation; school child; student; theoretical study; thinking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068565206"

A one-year long learning path supporting the development of CT skills in primary school students through game making activities was defined and tested in a case study with one grade 5 class. All students in the class were actively involved regardless of their personal interest, their participation was generally high, their skills increased along the project, and the main objectives were reached. Nevertheless, results suggest that a longer time span is needed for students to master deeply the new concepts and tools. Class organization proved to be crucial and this confirms the need for an adequate teachers’ training before introducing CT in classroom activities. Students demonstrated to be on the right path to approach CT through game making, but they still need to be guided in taking the player’s perspective and making their games easy to be understood and played.

Design/methodology/approach: A didactic intervention was performed for five weeks. Two student groups were taught the same computational concepts in two ways. One group was taught by constructing a video game within science content to practice science and computing curriculum while the other group constructed appropriately designed projects to practice only the computing curriculum. Additionally, the students constructed a pretest project before the beginning of the intervention and a post-test project after its end. Results were based on quantitative and qualitative code analysis and interviews from the students. Findings: VGM within science content resulted in projects with more CT skills and also supported students to effectively apply their acquired coding skills, after the end of the intervention. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest an interdisciplinary environment, such as the VGM within science content, which can effectively support CT skills development and computing curriculum.

In particular, the authors examine three different toys that have some sort of block-based coding interface. The authors juxtapose three different design features and the demands they place on young children learning to code. To examine the toys, the authors apply a framework developed based on Gibson’s theory of affordances and Palmer’s external representations. The authors look specifically at the toys: interface design, intended play scenario and representational conventions for computational ideas. Design/methodology/approach: As a research team, the authors have been playing with toys, observing their own children play with the toys and using them in kindergarten classrooms. In this paper, the authors reflect specifically on the design of the toys and the demands they place on children. Findings: The authors make no claims about whether one toy/design approach is superior to another. However, the differences that the authors articulate should serve as a provocation for researchers and designers to be mindful about what demands and expectations they place on young children as they learn to code and use code to learn in any given system. Research limitations/implications: As mentioned above, the authors want to start a discussion about design of these toys and how they shape children's experience with coding. Originality/value: There is a push to get coding and computational thinking into K-12, but there is not enough research on what this looks like in early childhood. Further, while research is starting to emerge on block-based programming vs text-based for older children and adults, little research has been done on the representational form of code for young children.

We measured their engagement and collaboration during the activity by recording their gaze, and their attitudes in relation to their learning, enjoyment, team-work and intention by post-activity survey instruments. Our analysis shows that there is a significant moderating effect of collaboration and engagement on children's attitudes. In other words, highly engaging and collaborative coding activities significantly moderate children's attitudes.

Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures.We measured students' perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task.We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot.

Learning to program computers has gained considerable popularity, and educational systems around the world are encouraging students in schools and even children in kindergartens to engage in programming activities. This popularity is based on the claim that learning computer programming improves cognitive skills, including creativity, reasoning, and mathematical skills. In this meta-analysis, we tested this claim performing a 3-level, random-effects meta-analysis on a sample of 105 studies and 539 effect sizes. We found evidence for a moderate, overall transfer effect (g = 0.49, 95% CI [0.37, 0.61]) and identified a strong effect for near transfer (g = 0.75, 95% CI [0.39, 1.11]) and a moderate effect for far transfer (g = 0.47, 95% CI [0.35, 0.59]). Positive transfer to situations that required creative thinking, mathematical skills, and metacognition, followed by spatial skills and reasoning existed. School achievement and literacy, however, benefited the least from learning to program. Moderator analyses revealed significantly larger transfer effects for studies with untreated control groups than those with treated (active) control groups. Moreover, published studies exhibited larger effects than gray literature. These findings shed light on the cognitive benefits associated with learning computer programming and contribute to the current debate surrounding the conceptualization of computer programming as a form of problem solving. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Cognitive skills; Computational thinking; Computer programming; Three-level meta-analysis; Transfer of skills","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055469905"

Findings: While each young person described a unique pathway and perspective, this study identified key experiences that motivated their participation, influenced their development and inspired their emergent leadership. These experiences included opportunities to learn through exploration, to receive feedback from peers, to engage in creative collaboration and to contribute to the community. Practical implications: This study discussed these findings in light of previous research on youth development, and it suggests that building on practices and principles from research on youth programs can help more young people become engaged in developing broader skills with coding. Originality/value: Youth highlighted experiences that enabled them to express their ideas, to build relationships, to help others and to see themselves in new ways. Their perspectives expand beyond the predominant focus of coding initiatives on computational thinking and problem-solving skills to also support social, leadership and identity development. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coding; Community; Leadership; Scratch; Youth; Youth development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064058361"

It draws on theories of learning and equity from the learning sciences to inform the understanding of women’s underrepresentation in computing as it investigates young women who showed an interest in computing in high school and followed-up with them in their college and careers. Design/methodology/approach: The mixed-methods approach compares data from quantitative surveys and qualitative focus groups and interviews. The sample comes from database of 1,500 young women who expressed interest in computing by applying for an award for high schoolers. These women were surveyed in 2013 and then again in 2016, with 511 women identifying themselves as high schoolers in 2013 and then having graduated and pursued college or careers in the second survey. The authors also conducted qualitative interviews and focus groups with 90 women from the same sample. Findings: The findings show that multiple factors influence women’s persistence in computing, but the best predictor of women’s persistence is access to early computing and programming opportunities. However, access and opportunities must be evaluated within broader social and contextual factors. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is that the authors measure women’s persistence in computing according to their chosen major or profession. This study does not measure the impact of computational thinking in women’s everyday lives. Practical implications: Educators and policymakers should consider efforts to make Computer Science-for-All a reality. Originality/value: Few longitudinal studies of a large sample of women exist that follow women interested in computing from high school into college and careers particularly from a critical educational equity perspective. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Computing; CS-for-All; Equity; Mixed-methods; STEM; Women","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063918898"

The authors suggest an alternate paradigm, procedural creativity, that calls for the development of conceptual creative spaces governed by procedurally generative principles. The authors also call for game development to be the focus of procedural creativity pedagogy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first discuss the limitations of the CT paradigm, focusing, in particular, on the issue of abstraction and representation as opposed to execution and action. The authors then define procedural creativity in more detail. Following that, they discuss the use of game development as pedagogy, with a focus on Margaret Boden’s notion of conceptual creative spaces. Findings: CT is limited because it focuses overly on solutions to computational “problems”, because it is tied too closely with economic concerns and because it focuses on abstraction at the cost of action. Procedural creativity, on the other hand, focuses on the individual’s capacity for personal expression with the computer and on the generative capacity of code in action. Game development is in ideal platform for procedural creativity because it emphasizes the development of creative domains and conceptual spaces.

As the boundary between physical and digital worlds blurs, there is a need for new digital tools and physical environments to support the everyday, cyber–physicalinteractions of children. This paper presents a Research-through-Design example of CyberPLAYce, a tangible, interactive, learning construction kit for children supporting storytelling and computational thinking (CT). The construction kit facilitates and enhances child-to-child, child-to-machine, and child-to-environment interactions through semi-structured play. It offers young students the opportunity to materialize their ideas through the construction of cyber–physical story algorithms allowing them to physically alter story segments while constructing and enhancing the storyline. The CyberPLAYce research places an emphasis on the importance of employing tangible learning tools in order to enhance children's active engagement. We focus on the motivations for CyberPLAYce, its participatory design, and results of an empirical study concerning CT with 8-12 year-old storytellers in a classroom setting. Results from the study suggest that cyber–physical activities afforded by CyberPLAYce cultivate engaged storytelling and CT practices in children. This multidisciplinary design-research contributes to construction tools for children, cyber–physical storytelling and story-construction activities, and tangible computing and programming activities that support CT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Childhood education; Computational thinking; Play; Prototyping; Tangible storytelling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061598599"

Extensive qualitative data were collected through classroom observations, teacher and student interviews and student artifact creation in four state-maintained primary school classrooms to explore how teachers acted agentically to minimize or altogether reject a legally mandated curriculum that clashed with their local, professional knowledge. Analysis of this data was supported by official documents and personal accounts of the creation of the computing program of study, which highlight a discourse of economic anxiety and post-imperialist nostalgia on the part of the curriculum’s designers.

Thirty Children aged 10–11 years, from a primary school in London took part in a game-making project using the Scratch and Alice 2.4 applications for eight months. For the focus of this specific paper, data from participant observations, informal conversations, problem-solving sheets, semi-structured interviews and children's completed games were used to make sense of elements of the computational thinking process and approaches to evaluate these elements in a computer game design context. The discussions around what CT consists, highlighted the complex structure of computational thinking and the interaction between the elements of artificial intelligence (AI), computer, cognitive, learning and psychological sciences. This also emphasised the role of metacognition in the Computational Thinking process. These arguments illustrated that it is not possible to evaluate Computational Thinking using only programming constructs, as CT process provides opportunities for developing many other skills and concepts. Therefore a multiple evaluation approach should be adopted to illustrate the full learning scope of the Computational Thinking Process. Using the support of literature review and the findings of the data analysis I proposed a multiple approach evaluation model where ‘computational concepts’ ‘metacognitive practices’ and ‘learning behaviours’ were discussed as the main elements of the CT process. Additionally, in order to investigate these dimensions within a game-making context, computer game design was also included in this evaluation model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alice; Assessment; Coding; Computational thinking; Elementary school; Game programming; Metacognition; Scratch","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056390283"

To achieve this, a systemic revision was made where attention was paid to four variables, namely: publication year; countries with more productions; the most productive authors in this field; and documentary sources with a higher number of publications. Added to this, we carried out a classification according to the types of documents and the research methods used, along with the educational stages under study and the programming language adopted. Publications are undoubtedly on an upward trend, Spain standing out as one of the most productive countries in this area. Likewise, evidence demonstrates not only that this field of study has been addressed using the two main research methods - quantitative and qualitative - but also that the emphasis has traditionally been placed on the primary education stage. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.
