J,Varghese_ VVV| Renumol_ VG,,,,Varghese_ V. V. Vinu| Renumol_ V. G.,,,Video games for assessing computational thinking: a systematic literature review,JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION,,,,,,,,,,,,Computational thinking (CT) is a widely researched domain. Many researchers around the world have conducted studies to define CT_ to develop CT in students_ and to assess CT using various tools and paradigms. Our review focuses on the assessment aspect of CT using digital games. Typically_ the assessment in CT is done using Multiple Choice Questions_ Portfolio analysis_ pen-and-paper methods_ and games. The use of video games to assess CT skills was one of the least explored areas. To further explore this area_ we did a systematic literature review on the use of video games to assess CT. The findings of our review are as follows: (1) CT skills such as abstraction_ algorithmic thinking_ data representation_ debugging_ decomposition_ pattern recognition_ recursive thinking_ simulation_ socialization_ heuristic_ iteration_ and problem-solving were primarily assessed using digital games. (2) The reviewed articles used samples ranging from 18 to 3355 participants. (3) The sample includes elementary_ middle-_ and high-school and graduate students. (4) In the reviewed articles_ it is observed that the time for treatment varied from a few hours to the entire school year. (5) A mixed-mode study using quantitative and qualitative methods was preferred by researchers to explore the CT aspects such as CT concepts_ practices_ and perspectives. (6) The use of video games_ stealth assessment_ educational data mining and machine learning for assessing CT skills is in a dormant state. (7) There is a lack of empirical evidence to prove that video games are effective to assess CT skills. This review paper will be helpful for researchers working on the assessment of CT skills using digital games.,,,,,,Varghese VV_ Vinu/0000-0001-8294-2373,,,,,,,,,,,,,2197-9987,2197-9995,,,,SEP,2024,11,3,,,,,921,966,,10.1007/s40692-023-00284-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40692-023-00284-w,,AUG 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001060553400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However_ there is an agreement in the scientific literature that important challenges exist_ such as keeping student engagement and the requirement of developing problem-solving skills_ and not just learning the code syntax. The inclusion of digital Game-Based Learning (GBL) has shown great potential. To better understand how it can be helpful to adult learners in STEM degrees_ a study was conducted on the application of two very popular commercial video games in different introductory programming courses at an online university_ during the introduction of basic programming topics (CS1). The methods combined a descriptive qualitative and a quantitative approach_ using a reflective journals and questionnaires_ which helped students consider and express their experiences_ how they interacted with the games_ how the games helped them better understand the topics_ and realize their personal progress and potential. Results showed that the use of these games as educational resources had a positive impact in their engagement and sense of self-efficacy_ but only if some important instructional considerations are taken into account.,,,,,,Garc¡a-Sol¢rzano_ David/0000-0001-6479-9497,,,,,,,,,,,,,1875-9521,1875-953X,,,,JAN,2020,52,,,,,,,,100850,10.1016/j.entcom.2024.100850,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2024.100850,,AUG 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001298330900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills_ but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation_ such as interests_ skills_ persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance_ so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim_ we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts_ based on intrinsic motivation_ and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months_ during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests_ skills_ achievement_ and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years_ regardless of gender_ as children persist with the challenge_ intrinsically motivated_ until it is overcome. In terms of persistence_ significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge_ which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender_ adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards_ especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.,,,,,Martin_ Estefania/C-4397-2008| Zapata-C ceres_ Mar¡a/GWV-3710-2022,Martin_ Estefania/0000-0001-5652-5592| Zapata-C ceres_ Mar¡a/0000-0002-8817-5889,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2021,9,,,,,,123588,123602,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3110475,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3110475,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000696076200001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,Kazimoglu_ C,,,,Kazimoglu_ Cagin,,,Enhancing Confidence in Using Computational Thinking Skills via Playing a Serious Game: A Case Study to Increase Motivation in Learning Computer Programming,IEEE ACCESS,,,,,,,,,,,,Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet_ there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students_ low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues_ video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming| b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence_ methods_ decision making and loops)| and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally_ students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.,,,,,kazimoglu_ cain/ABI-3431-2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2020,8,,,,,,221831,221851,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043278,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043278,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000600842500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study conducted a meta-analysis of 27 empirical studies to examine the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) for fostering students' CT. The effects of various factors on the learning process for acquiring CT were also examined. The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students' CT_ and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges' g = .600_ 95% CI [.465_ .735]_ p < .001). (b) Furthermore_ conducting GBL can improve students' CT concepts (Hedges' g = .916_ 95% CI [.410_ 1.423]_ p < .001)_ CT skills (Hedges' g = .494_ 95% CI [.389_ .600]_ p < .001)_ and CT perspectives (Hedges' g = .927_ 95% CI [.039_ 1.816]_ p < .05). (c) Additionally_ game mode_ teaching context_ and participant characteristics have positive effects on CT. Based on the findings_ it is suggested that using more unplugged games and video games_ designing collaborative game activities_ and tailoring approaches according to gender difference and programming experience can effectively promote CT. The results have significance for fostering students' CT in GBL| it is further suggested that instruction processes be rationally designed.,,,,,Wang_ Qiyun/F-2949-2010| zhao_ sunan/KIK-8443-2024,Ma_ Jingsi/0000-0002-4058-1271|,,,,,,,,,,,,,0735-6331,1541-4140,,,,DEC,2023,61,7,,,,,1430,1463,,10.1177/07356331231178948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/07356331231178948,,JUN 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001007522700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Following a STEAM approach_ the workshop aimed to engage participants in age-appropriate activities that focus on CT skills through the lens of creating their own game. A web-based game design interface that allows students to code and play games as simulated on a skyscraper was developed to support the workshop's core activities. The web environment also featured step-by-step tutorials and fully functional games to promote the accessibility of the learning materials for a diverse body of students and educators around the globe. The results of the study indicated that the workshop helped students improve their CT skills and differentially influence their attitudes towards computing. In particular_ the workshop experience led students from underserved community districts to lower their attitude ratings_ whereas the reverse pattern was observed for students from more affluent districts. The workshop reportedly informed students' perception of computing as a profession and their appreciation of the analytical effort required for developing functional games. Qualitative analysis of artifact-based interviews indicated that students could begin to make abstractions and devise algorithms by associating variables through conditional statements while solving problems related to game development. Interview analysis also revealed that students took pride in the effort that they made during the workshop.,,,,,| €akÕr_ Murat Perit/B-4939-2012,Lee_ Frank J/0000-0003-0475-2552| €akÕr_ Murat Perit/0000-0003-4295-1245| AKKU? €AKIR_ NUR/0000-0003-3651-6183,,,,,,,,,,,,,1042-1629,1556-6501,,,,OCT,2021,69,5,,,,,2683,2703,,10.1007/s11423-021-10031-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11423-021-10031-6,,AUG 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000680755900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Game-based learning (GBL) may be used to teach CT_ and it's necessary to clarify how to design and implement game-based CT teaching. The literature was systematically searched for empirical studies published between 2011 and 2021. Thirty-nine studies were included in the review and findings suggested that GBL has positive effects on CT_ but has non-significant effects on some CT elements (e.g._ conditions_ triggers_ and abstraction) because of limited time to learn these elements and students' preferences for using CT elements. Game elements_ particularly clear goals and rules_ progressive challenges_ immediate feedback_ storyline_ avatar_ social interaction and various reward mechanisms were used to motivate students to engage in activities to develop CT. Furthermore_ single or multiple theoretical foundations_ such as constructivist learning theory and experiential learning theory_ may guide the design and implementation of game-based activities.

However_ very little has been focused on student learning through game making_ especially in science. Moreover_ none of the studies on learning through making games has presented an account of how students engage in the process of game design in real time. The present study seeks to address that gap. We report an exploratory embedded case study in which three groups of students in one classroom created a computer game designed to teach peers about climate science_ while drawing on scientific knowledge_ principles of game design_ and computational thinking practices. Data sources were student design sheets_ computer video_ and audio screen capture while students created their game_ and interviews after completing the curriculum unit. A theme-driven framework was used to code the data. A curricular emphasis on systems across climate systems_ game design_ and computational thinking practices provided a context designed to synergistically supported student learning. This embedded case study provides a rich example of what a collaborative game design task in a constructionist context looks like in a middle school science classroom_ and how it supports student learning. Game design in a constructionist learning environment that emphasized learning through building a game allowed students to choose their pathways through the learning experience and resulted in learning for all despite various levels of programming experience. Our findings suggest that game design may be a promising context for supporting student learning in STEM disciplines.,,,,,Harteveld_ Casper/AAO-3308-2021,Harteveld_ Casper/0000-0002-8164-0303,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-4308,1098-2736,,,,APR,2024,61,4,,,,,772,808,,10.1002/tea.21918,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tea.21918,,DEC 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001113215200001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,Chugh_ R| Turnbull_ D,,,,Chugh_ Ritesh| Turnbull_ Darren,,,Gamification in education: A citation network analysis using CitNetExplorer,CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,Gaming is becoming a popular method of engaging students in learning processes across all levels of the educational community. The effective integration of gaming activities into course curricula has the potential to enhance student learning_ motivation_ and knowledge acquisition in a range of disciplines. However_ gamification of education is not without its opponents_ with many educators concerned about the negative impacts of game use on effective learning. This study enhances our understanding of contemporary practices related to the areas_ usage and characteristics of gamification in education. It is of particular relevance to educational institutions with a focus on developing innovative teaching methods and curricula that utilize gamification techniques in a multi-disciplinary_ cross-national context across all stages of formal learning. Through the use of bibliometric analysis techniques_ our study of the citation relations of 3_617 publications identified ten prominent themes dominated by gamification: mobile gaming_ physical education_ health and medicine_ business_ learning performance_ programming and computing_ English language_ teacher adoption_ primary & secondary education_ and mathematics. Clear evidence of increased student motivation to learn and improved course results were evident in the examined literature. This study will benefit serious game designers_ educators_ and educational institutions to develop more inclusive and engaging pedagogies that exploit the ubiquitous availability of gaming technologies for inclusion in more traditional course delivery methods.,,,,,Turnbull_ Darren/AAQ-5298-2021| Chugh_ Ritesh/AAB-5591-2020,Turnbull_ Darren/0000-0003-0509-8564| Chugh_ Ritesh/0000-0003-0061-7206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1309-517X,,,,APR,2023,15,2,,,,,,,ep405,10.30935/cedtech/12863,http://dx.doi.org/10.30935/cedtech/12863,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001105675600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

To know and internalize learning about this problem-solving heuristic_ the student has worked previously this kind of thought process with computational thinking using the educational resource. The work has been put into practice using a mixed methodology_ accomplishing a time-series experiment with non-substitutive pretest measures. This information has been completed with a qualitative measurement with the student's own perception about their learning process during the development of the empirical experience. To carry out the implementation of this experimental design_ the students have done a series of tasks designed with Scratch and developing a project to create a videogame based on solving arithmetic problems. The outcomes show positive results using this methodology and a useful implementation of the computational thinking as a transversal resource in Mathematics_ not only improving the mathematical competence but also the linguistic. An important improvement is observed in the reading and comprehension of the statement of the problem_ essential process to carry out good resolution of a problematic situation faced by a student using a problem-solving technique.,,,,,Adamuz-Povedano_ Natividad/D-9028-2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0210-2773,2341-2313,,,,JAN-MAR,2020,49,1,,,,,83,90,,10.17811/rifie.49.1.2020.83-90,http://dx.doi.org/10.17811/rifie.49.1.2020.83-90,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000533591900009,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,Bezine_ H,,,,Bezine_ Hala,,,Investigating how feedback and stroke structure affect Arabic learning/writing skills for preschool aged children,JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION,,,,,,,,,,,,The computer-based teaching system is now widely used in various classrooms as an active-learning component of courses. Many Educators may wonder whether this computerized tool is actually useful to learning and writing process or not. The current study aims to test the effectiveness of computerized tool for enhancing instructional techniques on teaching preschool children to write and learn Arabic characters. In this paper_ we attempt to explore the effect of immediate feedback which is provided as soon as the error was made and trace sequence character_ i.e._ stroke order and color. A total of 50 participants aged between 45 and 60 months learn to write a set of Arabic characters using the computerized tool. Findings demonstrate that children made more mistakes with the non-stroke structure than with the stroke-order structure. Thus_ the provision of basic stroke structure on computer-based handwriting task assists novice preschool learning and writing process. Furthermore_ the results imply that immediate feedback versus no feedback has been found beneficial for learning as it presents a remarkable impact on the handwriting task effectiveness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2197-9987,2197-9995,,,,SEP,2024,11,3,,,,,967,990,,10.1007/s40692-023-00286-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40692-023-00286-8,,JUL 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001034583200001,View Full Record in Web of Science
